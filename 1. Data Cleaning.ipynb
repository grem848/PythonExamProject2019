      "['Madam Speaker, Mr. Vice President, Members of Congress, the\\xa0First Lady of the United States, and my fellow Americans:', 'We meet tonight at a moment of unlimited potential.\\xa0As we begin a new Congress, I stand here ready to work with you to achieve historic breakthroughs for all Americans.', 'Millions of our fellow citizens are watching us now, gathered in this great chamber, hoping that we will govern not as two parties but as one Nation.', 'The agenda I will lay out this evening is not a Republican agenda or a Democrat agenda.\\xa0It is the agenda of the American people.', 'Many of us campaigned on the same core promises:\\xa0to defend American jobs and demand fair trade for American workers; to rebuild and revitalize our Nation’s infrastructure; to reduce the price of healthcare and prescription drugs; to create an immigration system that is safe, lawful, modern, and secure; and to pursue a foreign policy that puts America’s interests first.', 'There is a new opportunity in American politics, if only we have the courage to seize it.\\xa0Victory is not winning for our party.\\xa0Victory is winning for our country.', 'This year, America will recognize two important anniversaries that show us the majesty of America’s mission, and\\xa0the power of American pride.', 'In June, we mark 75 years since the start of what General Dwight D. Eisenhower called the Great Crusade—the Allied liberation of Europe in World War II.\\xa0On D-Day, June 6, 1944, 15,000 young American men jumped from the sky, and 60,000 more stormed in from the sea, to save our civilization from tyranny.\\xa0Here with us tonight are three of those heroes:\\xa0Private First Class Joseph Reilly, Staff Sergeant Irving Locker, and Sergeant Herman Zeitchik.\\xa0Gentlemen, we salute you.', 'In 2019, we also celebrate 50 years since brave young pilots flew a quarter of a million miles through space to plant the American flag on the face of the moon.\\xa0Half a century later, we are joined by one of the Apollo 11 astronauts who planted that flag:\\xa0Buzz Aldrin. This year, American astronauts will go back to space on American rockets.', 'In the 20th century, America saved freedom, transformed science, and redefined the middle class standard of living for the entire world to see.\\xa0Now, we must step boldly and bravely into the next chapter of this great American adventure, and we must create a new standard of living for the 21st century.\\xa0An amazing quality of life for all of our citizens is within our reach.', 'We can make our communities safer, our families stronger, our culture richer, our faith deeper, and our middle class bigger and more prosperous than ever before.', 'But we must reject the politics of revenge, resistance, and\\xa0retribution—and embrace the boundless potential of cooperation, compromise, and the common good.', 'Together, we can break decades of political stalemate.\\xa0We can bridge old divisions, heal old wounds, build new coalitions, forge new solutions, and unlock the extraordinary promise of America’s future.\\xa0The decision is ours to make.', 'We must choose between greatness or gridlock, results or resistance, vision or vengeance, incredible progress or pointless destruction.', 'Tonight, I ask you to choose greatness.', 'Over the last 2 years, my administration has moved with urgency and historic speed to confront problems neglected by leaders of both parties over many decades.', 'In just over 2 years since the election, we have launched an unprecedented economic boom—a boom that has rarely been seen before.\\xa0We have created 5.3 million new jobs and importantly added 600,000 new manufacturing jobs—something which almost everyone said was impossible to do, but the fact is, we are just getting started.', 'Wages are rising at the fastest pace in decades, and growing for blue collar workers, who I promised to fight for, faster than anyone else.\\xa0Nearly 5 million Americans have been lifted off food stamps.\\xa0The United States economy is growing almost twice as fast today as when I took office, and we are considered far and away the hottest economy anywhere in the world.\\xa0Unemployment has reached the lowest rate in half a century. African American, Hispanic American, and Asian American unemployment have all reached their lowest levels ever recorded. Unemployment for Americans with disabilities has also reached an all-time low.\\xa0More people are working now than at any time in our history–-157 million.', 'We passed a massive tax cut for working families and doubled the child tax credit.', 'We virtually ended the estate, or death, tax on small businesses, ranches, and family farms.', 'We eliminated the very unpopular Obamacare individual mandate penalty—and to give critically ill patients access to life-saving cures, we passed right to try.', 'My administration has cut more regulations in a short time than any other administration during its entire tenure.\\xa0Companies are coming back to our country in large numbers thanks to historic reductions in taxes and regulations.', 'We have unleashed a revolution in American energy—the United States is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas in the world.\\xa0And now, for the first time in 65 years, we are a net exporter of energy.', 'After 24 months of rapid progress, our economy is the envy of the world, our military is the most powerful on earth, and America is winning each and every day.\\xa0Members of Congress:\\xa0the State of our Union is strong.\\xa0Our country is vibrant and our economy is thriving like never before.', 'On Friday, it was announced that we added another 304,000 jobs last month alone—almost double what was expected.\\xa0An economic miracle is taking place in the United States—and the\\xa0only thing that can stop it are foolish wars, politics, or ridiculous partisan investigations.', 'If there is going to be peace and legislation, there cannot be war and investigation. It just doesn’t work that way!', 'We must be united at home to defeat our adversaries abroad.', 'This new era of cooperation can start with finally confirming the more than 300 highly qualified nominees who are still stuck in the Senate, some after years of waiting.\\xa0The Senate has failed to act on these nominations, which is unfair to the nominees and to our country.', 'Now is the time for bipartisan action.\\xa0Believe it or not, we have already proven that it is possible.', 'In the last Congress, both parties came together to pass unprecedented legislation to confront the opioid crisis, a sweeping new Farm Bill, historic VA reforms, and after four decades of rejection, we passed VA Accountability so we can finally terminate those who mistreat our wonderful veterans.', 'And just weeks ago, both parties united for groundbreaking criminal justice reform.\\xa0Last year, I heard through friends the story of Alice Johnson.\\xa0I was deeply moved.\\xa0In 1997, Alice was sentenced to life in prison as a first-time non-violent drug offender.\\xa0Over the next two decades, she became a prison minister, inspiring others to choose a better path.\\xa0She had a\\xa0big impact on that prison population—and far beyond.', 'Alice’s story underscores the disparities and unfairness that can exist in criminal sentencing—and the need to remedy this injustice.\\xa0She served almost 22 years and had expected to be in prison for the rest of her life.', 'In June, I commuted Alice’s sentence, and she is here with us tonight.\\xa0Alice, thank you for reminding us that we always have the power to shape our own destiny.', 'When I saw Alice’s beautiful family greet her at the prison gates, hugging and kissing and crying and laughing, I knew I did the right thing.', 'Inspired by stories like Alice’s, my administration worked closely with members of both parties to sign the First Step Act into law.\\xa0This legislation reformed sentencing laws that have wrongly and disproportionately harmed the African American community.\\xa0The First Step Act gives non-violent offenders the chance to re-enter society as productive, law-abiding citizens. Now, States across the country are following our lead. America is a Nation that believes in redemption.', 'We are also joined tonight by Matthew Charles from Tennessee.\\xa0In 1996, at age 30, Matthew was sentenced to 35 years for selling drugs and related offenses. Over the next two decades, he completed more than 30 Bible studies, became a law clerk, and mentored fellow inmates. Now, Matthew is the very first person to be released from prison under the First Step Act.\\xa0Matthew, on behalf of all Americans: welcome home.', 'As we have seen, when we are united, we can make astonishing strides for our country.\\xa0Now, Republicans and Democrats must join forces again to confront an urgent national crisis.', 'The Congress has 10 days left to pass a bill that will fund our government, protect our homeland, and secure our southern border.', 'Now is the time for the Congress to show the world that America is committed to ending illegal immigration and putting the ruthless coyotes, cartels, drug dealers, and human traffickers out of business.', 'As we speak, large, organized caravans are on the march to the United States.\\xa0We have just heard that Mexican cities, in order to remove the illegal immigrants from their communities, are getting trucks and buses to bring them up to our country in areas where there is little border protection.\\xa0I have ordered another 3,750 troops to our southern border to prepare for the tremendous onslaught.', 'This is a moral issue.\\xa0The lawless state of our southern border is a threat to the safety, security, and financial well‑being of all Americans.\\xa0We have a moral duty to create an\\xa0immigration system that protects the lives and jobs of our citizens.\\xa0This includes our obligation to the millions of immigrants living here today, who followed the rules and respected our laws. Legal immigrants enrich our Nation and strengthen our society in countless ways.\\xa0I want people to come into our country, but they have to come in legally.', 'Tonight, I am asking you to defend our very dangerous southern border out of love and devotion to our fellow citizens and to our country.', 'No issue better illustrates the divide between America’s working class and America’s political class than illegal immigration.\\xa0Wealthy politicians and donors push for open borders while living their lives behind walls and gates and guards.', 'Meanwhile, working class Americans are left to pay the price for mass illegal migration—reduced jobs, lower wages, overburdened schools and hospitals, increased crime, and a\\xa0depleted social safety net.', 'Tolerance for illegal immigration is not compassionate—it is cruel.\\xa0One in three women is sexually assaulted on the long journey north. Smugglers use migrant children as human pawns to exploit our laws and gain access to our country.', 'Human traffickers and sex traffickers take advantage of the wide open areas between our ports of entry to\\xa0smuggle thousands of young girls and women into the United\\xa0States and to sell them into prostitution and modern-day slavery.', 'Tens of thousands of innocent Americans are killed by lethal drugs that cross our border and flood into our cities—including meth, heroin, cocaine, and fentanyl.', 'The savage gang, MS-13, now operates in 20 different American states, and they almost all come through our southern border.\\xa0Just yesterday, an MS-13 gang member was taken into custody for a fatal shooting on a subway platform in New York City.\\xa0We are removing these gang members by the thousands, but until we secure our border they’re going to keep streaming back\\xa0in.', 'Year after year, countless Americans are murdered by criminal illegal aliens.', 'I’ve gotten to know many wonderful Angel Moms, Dads, and families—no one should ever have to suffer the horrible heartache they have endured.', 'Here tonight is Debra Bissell.\\xa0Just three weeks ago, Debra’s parents, Gerald and Sharon, were burglarized and shot to\\xa0death in their Reno, Nevada, home by an illegal alien. They\\xa0were in their eighties and are survived by four children, 11\\xa0grandchildren, and 20 great-grandchildren. Also here tonight are Gerald and Sharon’s granddaughter, Heather, and great‑granddaughter, Madison.', 'To Debra, Heather, Madison, please stand: few can understand your pain.\\xa0But I will never forget, and I will fight for the memory of Gerald and Sharon, that it should never happen again.', 'Not one more American life should be lost because our Nation failed to control its very dangerous border.', 'In the last 2 years, our brave ICE officers made 266,000 arrests of criminal aliens, including those charged or convicted of nearly 100,000 assaults, 30,000 sex crimes, and 4,000 killings.', 'We are joined tonight by one of those law enforcement heroes:\\xa0ICE Special Agent Elvin Hernandez.\\xa0When Elvin was a boy, he and his family legally immigrated to the United States from the Dominican Republic.\\xa0At the age of eight, Elvin told his dad he wanted to become a Special Agent.\\xa0Today, he leads investigations into the scourge of international sex trafficking.\\xa0Elvin says: \\xa0“If I can make sure these young girls get their justice, I’ve done my job.”\\xa0Thanks to his work and that of his colleagues, more than 300 women and girls have been rescued from horror, and more than 1,500 sadistic traffickers have been put behind bars in the last year.', 'Special Agent Hernandez, please stand:\\xa0We will always support the brave men and women of Law Enforcement—and I pledge to you tonight that we will never abolish our heroes from ICE.', 'My administration has sent to the Congress a commonsense proposal to end the crisis on our southern border.', 'It includes humanitarian assistance, more law enforcement, drug detection at our ports, closing loopholes that enable child smuggling, and plans for a new physical barrier, or wall, to secure the vast areas between our ports of entry.\\xa0In the past, most of the people in this room voted for a wall—but the proper wall never got built. I’ll get it built.', 'This is a smart, strategic, see-through steel barrier—not just a simple concrete wall. It will be deployed in the areas identified by border agents as having the greatest need, and as these agents will tell you, where walls go up, illegal crossings go way down.', 'San Diego used to have the most illegal border crossings in the country.\\xa0In response, and at the request of San Diego residents and political leaders, a strong security wall was put in place.\\xa0This powerful barrier almost completely ended illegal crossings.', 'The border city of El Paso, Texas, used to have extremely high rates of violent crime—one of the highest in the country, and considered one of our Nation’s most dangerous cities.\\xa0Now, with a powerful barrier in place, El Paso is one\\xa0of our safest cities.', 'Simply put, walls work and walls save lives.\\xa0So let’s work together, compromise, and reach a deal that will truly make America safe.', 'As we work to defend our people’s safety, we must also ensure our economic resurgence continues at a rapid pace.', 'No one has benefitted more from our thriving economy than women, who have filled 58 percent of the new jobs created in the last year. All Americans can be proud that we have more women in the workforce than ever before—and exactly one century after the Congress passed the Constitutional amendment giving women the right to vote, we also have more women serving in the Congress than ever before.', 'As part of our commitment to improving opportunity for women everywhere, this Thursday we are launching the first ever Government-wide initiative focused on economic empowerment for women in developing countries.', 'To build on our incredible economic success, one priority is paramount—reversing decades of calamitous trade policies.', 'We are now making it clear to China that after years of targeting our industries\\xa0and stealing our intellectual property, the theft of\\xa0American jobs and wealth has come to an end.', 'Therefore, we recently imposed tariffs on $250 billion of Chinese goods—and now our Treasury is receiving billions of dollars a month from a country that never gave us a\\xa0dime.\\xa0But I\\xa0don’t blame China for taking advantage of us—I\\xa0blame our leaders and representatives for allowing this travesty to happen.\\xa0I have great respect for President Xi, and we are now working on a new trade deal with China.\\xa0But it must include real, structural change to end unfair trade practices, reduce our chronic trade deficit, and protect American jobs.', 'Another historic trade blunder was the catastrophe known as NAFTA.', 'I have met the men and women of Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Indiana, New Hampshire, and many other states whose dreams were shattered by NAFTA.\\xa0For years, politicians promised them they would negotiate for a better deal. But no one ever tried—until now.', 'Our new U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement—or USMCA—will replace NAFTA and deliver for American workers:\\xa0bringing back\\xa0our manufacturing jobs, expanding American agriculture, protecting intellectual property, and ensuring that more cars are proudly stamped with four beautiful words:\\xa0made in the USA.', 'Tonight, I am also asking you to pass the United States Reciprocal Trade Act, so that if another country places an unfair tariff on an American product, we can charge them the exact same tariff on the same product that they sell to us.', 'Both parties should be able to unite for a great rebuilding of America’s crumbling infrastructure.', 'I know that the Congress is eager to pass an infrastructure bill—and I am eager to work with you on legislation to deliver new and important infrastructure investment, including investments in the cutting edge industries of the future.\\xa0This is not an option.\\xa0This is a necessity.', 'The next major priority for me, and for all of us, should be to lower the cost of healthcare and prescription drugs—and to protect patients with pre-existing conditions.', 'Already, as a result of my administration’s efforts, in 2018 drug prices experienced their single largest decline in 46\\xa0years.', 'But we must do more.\\xa0It is unacceptable that Americans pay vastly more than people in other countries for the exact same drugs, often made in the exact same place.\\xa0This is wrong, unfair, and together we can stop it.', 'I am asking the Congress to pass legislation that finally takes on the problem of global freeloading and delivers fairness and price transparency for American patients. We should also require drug companies, insurance companies, and hospitals to disclose real prices to foster competition and bring costs down.', 'No force in history has done more to advance the human condition than American freedom.\\xa0In recent years we have made remarkable progress in the fight against HIV and AIDS.\\xa0Scientific breakthroughs have brought a once-distant dream within reach.\\xa0My budget will ask Democrats and Republicans to make the needed commitment to eliminate the HIV epidemic in the United States within 10 years.\\xa0Together, we will defeat AIDS in\\xa0America.', 'Tonight, I am also asking you to join me in another fight that all Americans can get behind:\\xa0the fight against childhood cancer.', 'Joining Melania in the gallery this evening is a very brave 10-year-old girl, Grace Eline. Every birthday since she was 4, Grace asked her friends to donate to St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital.\\xa0She did not know that one day she might be a\\xa0patient herself.\\xa0Last year, Grace was diagnosed with brain cancer.\\xa0Immediately, she began radiation treatment.\\xa0At the same time, she rallied her community and raised more than $40,000 for the fight against cancer. When Grace completed treatment last fall, her doctors and nurses cheered with tears in their eyes as she hung up a poster that read:\\xa0“Last Day of Chemo.”\\xa0Grace—you are an inspiration to us all.', 'Many childhood cancers have not seen new therapies in decades.\\xa0My budget will ask the Congress for $500 million over the next 10 years to fund this critical life-saving research.', 'To help support working parents, the time has come to pass school choice for America’s children.\\xa0I am also proud to be the first President to include in my budget a plan for nationwide paid family leave—so that every new parent has the chance to bond with their newborn child.', 'There could be no greater contrast to the beautiful image of a mother holding her infant child than the chilling displays our Nation saw in recent days.\\xa0Lawmakers in New York cheered with delight upon the passage of legislation that would allow a\\xa0baby to be ripped from the mother’s womb moments before birth.\\xa0These are living, feeling, beautiful babies who will never get the chance to share their love and dreams with the world.\\xa0And then, we had the case of the Governor of Virginia where he basically stated he would execute a baby after birth.', 'To defend the dignity of every person, I am asking the Congress to pass legislation to prohibit the late-term abortion of children who can feel pain in the mother’s womb.', 'Let us work together to build a culture that cherishes innocent life.\\xa0And let us reaffirm a fundamental truth:\\xa0all children—born and unborn— are made in the holy image of\\xa0God.', 'The final part of my agenda is to protect America’s National Security.', 'Over the last 2 years, we have begun to fully rebuild the\\xa0United States Military—with $700 billion last year and $716 billion this year.\\xa0We are also getting other nations to pay their fair share.\\xa0For years, the United States was being treated very unfairly by NATO—but now we have secured a $100\\xa0billion increase in defense spending from\\xa0NATO allies.', 'As part of our military build-up, the United States is developing a state-of-the-art Missile Defense System.', 'Under my administration, we will never apologize for advancing America’s interests.', 'For example, decades ago the United States entered into a\\xa0treaty with Russia in which we agreed to limit and reduce our missile capabilities.\\xa0While we followed the agreement to the letter, Russia repeatedly violated its terms.\\xa0That is why I\\xa0announced that the United States is officially withdrawing from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, or INF Treaty.', 'Perhaps we can negotiate a different agreement, adding China and others, or perhaps we can’t–-in which case, we will outspend and out-innovate all others by far.', 'As part of a bold new diplomacy, we continue our historic push for peace on the Korean Peninsula.\\xa0Our hostages have come home, nuclear testing has stopped, and there has not been a missile launch in 15 months. If I had not been elected President of the United States, we would right now, in my opinion, be in a major war with North Korea with potentially millions of people killed.\\xa0Much work remains to be done, but my relationship with Kim Jong Un is a good one.\\xa0And Chairman Kim and I will meet again on February 27 and 28 in Vietnam.', 'Two weeks ago, the United States officially recognized the legitimate government of Venezuela, and its new interim President, Juan Guaido.', 'We stand with the Venezuelan people in their noble quest for freedom—and we condemn the brutality of the Maduro regime, whose socialist policies have turned that nation from being the wealthiest in South America into a state of abject poverty and despair.', 'Here, in the United States, we are alarmed by new calls to adopt socialism in our country.\\xa0America was founded on liberty and independence–-not government coercion, domination, and control.\\xa0We are born free, and we will stay free.\\xa0Tonight, we\\xa0renew our resolve that America will never be a socialist country.', 'One of the most complex set of challenges we face is in the Middle East.', 'Our approach is based on principled realism—not discredited theories that have failed for decades to yield progress.\\xa0For this reason, my administration recognized the true capital of Israel—and proudly opened the American Embassy in Jerusalem.', 'Our brave troops have now been fighting in the Middle East for almost 19 years.\\xa0In Afghanistan and Iraq, nearly 7,000 American heroes have given their lives.\\xa0More than 52,000 Americans have been badly wounded.\\xa0We have spent more than $7\\xa0trillion in the Middle East.', 'As a candidate for President, I pledged a new approach. Great nations do not fight endless wars.', 'When I took office, ISIS controlled more than 20,000 square miles in Iraq and Syria.\\xa0Today, we have liberated virtually all of that territory from the grip of these bloodthirsty killers.', 'Now, as we work with our allies to destroy the remnants of ISIS, it is time to give our brave warriors in Syria a warm welcome home.', 'I have also accelerated our negotiations to reach a political settlement in Afghanistan.\\xa0Our troops have fought with unmatched valor—and thanks to their bravery, we are now able to pursue a political solution to this long and bloody conflict.', 'In Afghanistan, my administration is holding constructive talks with a number of Afghan groups, including the Taliban.\\xa0As we make progress in these negotiations, we will be able to reduce our troop presence and focus on counter-terrorism.\\xa0We do not know whether we will achieve an agreement—but we do know that after two decades of war, the hour has come to at least try for peace.', 'Above all, friend and foe alike must never doubt this Nation’s power and will to defend our people.\\xa0Eighteen years ago, terrorists attacked the USS Cole—and last month American forces killed one of the leaders of the attack.', 'We are honored to be joined tonight by Tom Wibberley, whose son, Navy Seaman Craig Wibberley, was one of the 17 sailors we tragically lost. Tom: we vow to always remember the heroes of the USS Cole.', 'My administration has acted decisively to confront the world’s leading state sponsor of terror: the radical regime in Iran.', 'To ensure this corrupt dictatorship never acquires nuclear weapons, I withdrew the United States from the disastrous Iran nuclear deal.\\xa0And last fall, we put in place the toughest sanctions ever imposed on a country.', 'We will not avert our eyes from a regime that chants death to America and threatens genocide against the Jewish people.\\xa0We must never ignore the vile poison of anti-Semitism, or those who spread its venomous creed.\\xa0With one voice, we must confront this hatred anywhere and everywhere it occurs.', 'Just months ago, 11 Jewish-Americans were viciously murdered in an anti-semitic attack on the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh.\\xa0SWAT Officer Timothy Matson raced into the gunfire and was shot seven times chasing down the killer.\\xa0Timothy has just had his 12th surgery—but he made the trip to\\xa0be here with us tonight.\\xa0Officer Matson: we are forever grateful for your courage in the face of evil.', 'Tonight, we are also joined by Pittsburgh survivor Judah Samet.\\xa0He arrived at the synagogue as the massacre began. But not only did Judah narrowly escape death last fall—more than seven decades ago, he narrowly survived the Nazi concentration camps. Today is Judah’s 81st birthday.\\xa0Judah says he can still remember the exact moment, nearly 75 years ago, after 10 months in a concentration camp, when he and his family were put on a train, and told they were going to another camp.\\xa0Suddenly the train screeched to a halt.\\xa0A soldier appeared.\\xa0Judah’s family braced for the worst.\\xa0Then, his father cried out with joy: \\xa0“It’s the Americans.”', 'A second Holocaust survivor who is here tonight, Joshua Kaufman, was a prisoner at Dachau Concentration Camp. He remembers watching through a hole in the wall of a cattle car as American soldiers rolled in with tanks.\\xa0“To me,” Joshua recalls, “the American soldiers were proof that God exists, and they came down from the sky.”', 'I began this evening by honoring three soldiers who fought on D-Day in the Second World War. One of them was Herman Zeitchik.\\xa0But there is more to Herman’s story. A year after he stormed the beaches of Normandy, Herman was one of those American soldiers who helped liberate Dachau.\\xa0He was one of the Americans who helped rescue Joshua from that hell on\\xa0earth. Almost 75 years later, Herman and Joshua are both together in the gallery tonight—seated side-by-side, here in the home of American freedom.\\xa0Herman and Joshua:\\xa0your presence this evening honors and uplifts our entire Nation.', 'When American soldiers set out beneath the dark skies over the English Channel in the early hours of D-Day, 1944, they were just young men of 18 and 19, hurtling on fragile landing craft toward the most momentous battle in the history of war.', 'They did not know if they would survive the hour. They did not know if they would grow old.\\xa0But they knew that America had to prevail. Their cause was this Nation, and generations yet unborn.', 'Why did they do it? They did it for America—they did it for us.', 'Everything that has come since—our triumph over communism, our giant leaps of science and discovery, our unrivaled progress toward equality and justice—all of it is possible thanks to the blood and tears and courage and vision of the Americans who came before.', 'Think of this Capitol—think of this very chamber, where lawmakers before you voted to end slavery, to build the railroads and the highways, to defeat fascism, to secure civil rights, to face down an evil empire.', 'Here tonight, we have legislators from across this magnificent republic.\\xa0You have come from the rocky shores of Maine and the volcanic peaks of Hawaii; from the snowy woods of Wisconsin and the red deserts of Arizona; from the green farms of Kentucky and the golden beaches of California. Together, we represent the most extraordinary Nation in all of history.', 'What will we do with this moment? How will we be remembered?', 'I ask the men and women of this Congress:\\xa0Look at the opportunities before us!\\xa0Our most thrilling achievements are still ahead.\\xa0Our most exciting journeys still await.\\xa0Our biggest victories are still to come. We have not yet begun to\\xa0dream.', 'We must choose whether we are defined by our differences—or whether we dare to transcend them.', 'We must choose whether we will squander our inheritance—or whether we will proudly declare that we are Americans. We do the incredible.\\xa0We defy the impossible.\\xa0We conquer the unknown.', 'This is the time to re-ignite the American imagination.\\xa0This is the time to search for the tallest summit\\xa0and set our sights on the brightest star. This is the time to rekindle the bonds of love and loyalty and memory that link us together as citizens, as neighbors, as patriots.', 'This is our future—our fate—and our choice to make. I\\xa0am asking you to choose greatness.', 'No matter the trials we face, no matter the challenges to come, we must go forward together.', 'We must keep America first in our hearts.\\xa0We must keep freedom alive in our souls. And we must always keep faith in America’s destiny—that one Nation, under God, must be the hope and the promise and the light and the glory among all the nations of the world!', 'Thank you. God Bless You, God Bless America, and good night!']\n"

       "['Madam Speaker, Mr. Vice President, Members of Congress, the\\xa0First Lady of the United States, and my fellow Americans: We meet tonight at a moment of unlimited potential.\\xa0As we begin a new Congress, I stand here ready to work with you to achieve historic breakthroughs for all Americans. Millions of our fellow citizens are watching us now, gathered in this great chamber, hoping that we will govern not as two parties but as one Nation. The agenda I will lay out this evening is not a Republican agenda or a Democrat agenda.\\xa0It is the agenda of the American people. Many of us campaigned on the same core promises:\\xa0to defend American jobs and demand fair trade for American workers; to rebuild and revitalize our Nation’s infrastructure; to reduce the price of healthcare and prescription drugs; to create an immigration system that is safe, lawful, modern, and secure; and to pursue a foreign policy that puts America’s interests first. There is a new opportunity in American politics, if only we have the courage to seize it.\\xa0Victory is not winning for our party.\\xa0Victory is winning for our country. This year, America will recognize two important anniversaries that show us the majesty of America’s mission, and\\xa0the power of American pride. In June, we mark 75 years since the start of what General Dwight D. Eisenhower called the Great Crusade—the Allied liberation of Europe in World War II.\\xa0On D-Day, June 6, 1944, 15,000 young American men jumped from the sky, and 60,000 more stormed in from the sea, to save our civilization from tyranny.\\xa0Here with us tonight are three of those heroes:\\xa0Private First Class Joseph Reilly, Staff Sergeant Irving Locker, and Sergeant Herman Zeitchik.\\xa0Gentlemen, we salute you. In 2019, we also celebrate 50 years since brave young pilots flew a quarter of a million miles through space to plant the American flag on the face of the moon.\\xa0Half a century later, we are joined by one of the Apollo 11 astronauts who planted that flag:\\xa0Buzz Aldrin. This year, American astronauts will go back to space on American rockets. In the 20th century, America saved freedom, transformed science, and redefined the middle class standard of living for the entire world to see.\\xa0Now, we must step boldly and bravely into the next chapter of this great American adventure, and we must create a new standard of living for the 21st century.\\xa0An amazing quality of life for all of our citizens is within our reach. We can make our communities safer, our families stronger, our culture richer, our faith deeper, and our middle class bigger and more prosperous than ever before. But we must reject the politics of revenge, resistance, and\\xa0retribution—and embrace the boundless potential of cooperation, compromise, and the common good. Together, we can break decades of political stalemate.\\xa0We can bridge old divisions, heal old wounds, build new coalitions, forge new solutions, and unlock the extraordinary promise of America’s future.\\xa0The decision is ours to make. We must choose between greatness or gridlock, results or resistance, vision or vengeance, incredible progress or pointless destruction. Tonight, I ask you to choose greatness. Over the last 2 years, my administration has moved with urgency and historic speed to confront problems neglected by leaders of both parties over many decades. In just over 2 years since the election, we have launched an unprecedented economic boom—a boom that has rarely been seen before.\\xa0We have created 5.3 million new jobs and importantly added 600,000 new manufacturing jobs—something which almost everyone said was impossible to do, but the fact is, we are just getting started. Wages are rising at the fastest pace in decades, and growing for blue collar workers, who I promised to fight for, faster than anyone else.\\xa0Nearly 5 million Americans have been lifted off food stamps.\\xa0The United States economy is growing almost twice as fast today as when I took office, and we are considered far and away the hottest economy anywhere in the world.\\xa0Unemployment has reached the lowest rate in half a century. African American, Hispanic American, and Asian American unemployment have all reached their lowest levels ever recorded. Unemployment for Americans with disabilities has also reached an all-time low.\\xa0More people are working now than at any time in our history–-157 million. We passed a massive tax cut for working families and doubled the child tax credit. We virtually ended the estate, or death, tax on small businesses, ranches, and family farms. We eliminated the very unpopular Obamacare individual mandate penalty—and to give critically ill patients access to life-saving cures, we passed right to try. My administration has cut more regulations in a short time than any other administration during its entire tenure.\\xa0Companies are coming back to our country in large numbers thanks to historic reductions in taxes and regulations. We have unleashed a revolution in American energy—the United States is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas in the world.\\xa0And now, for the first time in 65 years, we are a net exporter of energy. After 24 months of rapid progress, our economy is the envy of the world, our military is the most powerful on earth, and America is winning each and every day.\\xa0Members of Congress:\\xa0the State of our Union is strong.\\xa0Our country is vibrant and our economy is thriving like never before. On Friday, it was announced that we added another 304,000 jobs last month alone—almost double what was expected.\\xa0An economic miracle is taking place in the United States—and the\\xa0only thing that can stop it are foolish wars, politics, or ridiculous partisan investigations. If there is going to be peace and legislation, there cannot be war and investigation. It just doesn’t work that way! We must be united at home to defeat our adversaries abroad. This new era of cooperation can start with finally confirming the more than 300 highly qualified nominees who are still stuck in the Senate, some after years of waiting.\\xa0The Senate has failed to act on these nominations, which is unfair to the nominees and to our country. Now is the time for bipartisan action.\\xa0Believe it or not, we have already proven that it is possible. In the last Congress, both parties came together to pass unprecedented legislation to confront the opioid crisis, a sweeping new Farm Bill, historic VA reforms, and after four decades of rejection, we passed VA Accountability so we can finally terminate those who mistreat our wonderful veterans. And just weeks ago, both parties united for groundbreaking criminal justice reform.\\xa0Last year, I heard through friends the story of Alice Johnson.\\xa0I was deeply moved.\\xa0In 1997, Alice was sentenced to life in prison as a first-time non-violent drug offender.\\xa0Over the next two decades, she became a prison minister, inspiring others to choose a better path.\\xa0She had a\\xa0big impact on that prison population—and far beyond. Alice’s story underscores the disparities and unfairness that can exist in criminal sentencing—and the need to remedy this injustice.\\xa0She served almost 22 years and had expected to be in prison for the rest of her life. In June, I commuted Alice’s sentence, and she is here with us tonight.\\xa0Alice, thank you for reminding us that we always have the power to shape our own destiny. When I saw Alice’s beautiful family greet her at the prison gates, hugging and kissing and crying and laughing, I knew I did the right thing. Inspired by stories like Alice’s, my administration worked closely with members of both parties to sign the First Step Act into law.\\xa0This legislation reformed sentencing laws that have wrongly and disproportionately harmed the African American community.\\xa0The First Step Act gives non-violent offenders the chance to re-enter society as productive, law-abiding citizens. Now, States across the country are following our lead. America is a Nation that believes in redemption. We are also joined tonight by Matthew Charles from Tennessee.\\xa0In 1996, at age 30, Matthew was sentenced to 35 years for selling drugs and related offenses. Over the next two decades, he completed more than 30 Bible studies, became a law clerk, and mentored fellow inmates. Now, Matthew is the very first person to be released from prison under the First Step Act.\\xa0Matthew, on behalf of all Americans: welcome home. As we have seen, when we are united, we can make astonishing strides for our country.\\xa0Now, Republicans and Democrats must join forces again to confront an urgent national crisis. The Congress has 10 days left to pass a bill that will fund our government, protect our homeland, and secure our southern border. Now is the time for the Congress to show the world that America is committed to ending illegal immigration and putting the ruthless coyotes, cartels, drug dealers, and human traffickers out of business. As we speak, large, organized caravans are on the march to the United States.\\xa0We have just heard that Mexican cities, in order to remove the illegal immigrants from their communities, are getting trucks and buses to bring them up to our country in areas where there is little border protection.\\xa0I have ordered another 3,750 troops to our southern border to prepare for the tremendous onslaught. This is a moral issue.\\xa0The lawless state of our southern border is a threat to the safety, security, and financial well‑being of all Americans.\\xa0We have a moral duty to create an\\xa0immigration system that protects the lives and jobs of our citizens.\\xa0This includes our obligation to the millions of immigrants living here today, who followed the rules and respected our laws. Legal immigrants enrich our Nation and strengthen our society in countless ways.\\xa0I want people to come into our country, but they have to come in legally. Tonight, I am asking you to defend our very dangerous southern border out of love and devotion to our fellow citizens and to our country. No issue better illustrates the divide between America’s working class and America’s political class than illegal immigration.\\xa0Wealthy politicians and donors push for open borders while living their lives behind walls and gates and guards. Meanwhile, working class Americans are left to pay the price for mass illegal migration—reduced jobs, lower wages, overburdened schools and hospitals, increased crime, and a\\xa0depleted social safety net. Tolerance for illegal immigration is not compassionate—it is cruel.\\xa0One in three women is sexually assaulted on the long journey north. Smugglers use migrant children as human pawns to exploit our laws and gain access to our country. Human traffickers and sex traffickers take advantage of the wide open areas between our ports of entry to\\xa0smuggle thousands of young girls and women into the United\\xa0States and to sell them into prostitution and modern-day slavery. Tens of thousands of innocent Americans are killed by lethal drugs that cross our border and flood into our cities—including meth, heroin, cocaine, and fentanyl. The savage gang, MS-13, now operates in 20 different American states, and they almost all come through our southern border.\\xa0Just yesterday, an MS-13 gang member was taken into custody for a fatal shooting on a subway platform in New York City.\\xa0We are removing these gang members by the thousands, but until we secure our border they’re going to keep streaming back\\xa0in. Year after year, countless Americans are murdered by criminal illegal aliens. I’ve gotten to know many wonderful Angel Moms, Dads, and families—no one should ever have to suffer the horrible heartache they have endured. Here tonight is Debra Bissell.\\xa0Just three weeks ago, Debra’s parents, Gerald and Sharon, were burglarized and shot to\\xa0death in their Reno, Nevada, home by an illegal alien. They\\xa0were in their eighties and are survived by four children, 11\\xa0grandchildren, and 20 great-grandchildren. Also here tonight are Gerald and Sharon’s granddaughter, Heather, and great‑granddaughter, Madison. To Debra, Heather, Madison, please stand: few can understand your pain.\\xa0But I will never forget, and I will fight for the memory of Gerald and Sharon, that it should never happen again. Not one more American life should be lost because our Nation failed to control its very dangerous border. In the last 2 years, our brave ICE officers made 266,000 arrests of criminal aliens, including those charged or convicted of nearly 100,000 assaults, 30,000 sex crimes, and 4,000 killings. We are joined tonight by one of those law enforcement heroes:\\xa0ICE Special Agent Elvin Hernandez.\\xa0When Elvin was a boy, he and his family legally immigrated to the United States from the Dominican Republic.\\xa0At the age of eight, Elvin told his dad he wanted to become a Special Agent.\\xa0Today, he leads investigations into the scourge of international sex trafficking.\\xa0Elvin says: \\xa0“If I can make sure these young girls get their justice, I’ve done my job.”\\xa0Thanks to his work and that of his colleagues, more than 300 women and girls have been rescued from horror, and more than 1,500 sadistic traffickers have been put behind bars in the last year. Special Agent Hernandez, please stand:\\xa0We will always support the brave men and women of Law Enforcement—and I pledge to you tonight that we will never abolish our heroes from ICE. My administration has sent to the Congress a commonsense proposal to end the crisis on our southern border. It includes humanitarian assistance, more law enforcement, drug detection at our ports, closing loopholes that enable child smuggling, and plans for a new physical barrier, or wall, to secure the vast areas between our ports of entry.\\xa0In the past, most of the people in this room voted for a wall—but the proper wall never got built. I’ll get it built. This is a smart, strategic, see-through steel barrier—not just a simple concrete wall. It will be deployed in the areas identified by border agents as having the greatest need, and as these agents will tell you, where walls go up, illegal crossings go way down. San Diego used to have the most illegal border crossings in the country.\\xa0In response, and at the request of San Diego residents and political leaders, a strong security wall was put in place.\\xa0This powerful barrier almost completely ended illegal crossings. The border city of El Paso, Texas, used to have extremely high rates of violent crime—one of the highest in the country, and considered one of our Nation’s most dangerous cities.\\xa0Now, with a powerful barrier in place, El Paso is one\\xa0of our safest cities. Simply put, walls work and walls save lives.\\xa0So let’s work together, compromise, and reach a deal that will truly make America safe. As we work to defend our people’s safety, we must also ensure our economic resurgence continues at a rapid pace. No one has benefitted more from our thriving economy than women, who have filled 58 percent of the new jobs created in the last year. All Americans can be proud that we have more women in the workforce than ever before—and exactly one century after the Congress passed the Constitutional amendment giving women the right to vote, we also have more women serving in the Congress than ever before. As part of our commitment to improving opportunity for women everywhere, this Thursday we are launching the first ever Government-wide initiative focused on economic empowerment for women in developing countries. To build on our incredible economic success, one priority is paramount—reversing decades of calamitous trade policies. We are now making it clear to China that after years of targeting our industries\\xa0and stealing our intellectual property, the theft of\\xa0American jobs and wealth has come to an end. Therefore, we recently imposed tariffs on $250 billion of Chinese goods—and now our Treasury is receiving billions of dollars a month from a country that never gave us a\\xa0dime.\\xa0But I\\xa0don’t blame China for taking advantage of us—I\\xa0blame our leaders and representatives for allowing this travesty to happen.\\xa0I have great respect for President Xi, and we are now working on a new trade deal with China.\\xa0But it must include real, structural change to end unfair trade practices, reduce our chronic trade deficit, and protect American jobs. Another historic trade blunder was the catastrophe known as NAFTA. I have met the men and women of Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Indiana, New Hampshire, and many other states whose dreams were shattered by NAFTA.\\xa0For years, politicians promised them they would negotiate for a better deal. But no one ever tried—until now. Our new U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement—or USMCA—will replace NAFTA and deliver for American workers:\\xa0bringing back\\xa0our manufacturing jobs, expanding American agriculture, protecting intellectual property, and ensuring that more cars are proudly stamped with four beautiful words:\\xa0made in the USA. Tonight, I am also asking you to pass the United States Reciprocal Trade Act, so that if another country places an unfair tariff on an American product, we can charge them the exact same tariff on the same product that they sell to us. Both parties should be able to unite for a great rebuilding of America’s crumbling infrastructure. I know that the Congress is eager to pass an infrastructure bill—and I am eager to work with you on legislation to deliver new and important infrastructure investment, including investments in the cutting edge industries of the future.\\xa0This is not an option.\\xa0This is a necessity. The next major priority for me, and for all of us, should be to lower the cost of healthcare and prescription drugs—and to protect patients with pre-existing conditions. Already, as a result of my administration’s efforts, in 2018 drug prices experienced their single largest decline in 46\\xa0years. But we must do more.\\xa0It is unacceptable that Americans pay vastly more than people in other countries for the exact same drugs, often made in the exact same place.\\xa0This is wrong, unfair, and together we can stop it. I am asking the Congress to pass legislation that finally takes on the problem of global freeloading and delivers fairness and price transparency for American patients. We should also require drug companies, insurance companies, and hospitals to disclose real prices to foster competition and bring costs down. No force in history has done more to advance the human condition than American freedom.\\xa0In recent years we have made remarkable progress in the fight against HIV and AIDS.\\xa0Scientific breakthroughs have brought a once-distant dream within reach.\\xa0My budget will ask Democrats and Republicans to make the needed commitment to eliminate the HIV epidemic in the United States within 10 years.\\xa0Together, we will defeat AIDS in\\xa0America. Tonight, I am also asking you to join me in another fight that all Americans can get behind:\\xa0the fight against childhood cancer. Joining Melania in the gallery this evening is a very brave 10-year-old girl, Grace Eline. Every birthday since she was 4, Grace asked her friends to donate to St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital.\\xa0She did not know that one day she might be a\\xa0patient herself.\\xa0Last year, Grace was diagnosed with brain cancer.\\xa0Immediately, she began radiation treatment.\\xa0At the same time, she rallied her community and raised more than $40,000 for the fight against cancer. When Grace completed treatment last fall, her doctors and nurses cheered with tears in their eyes as she hung up a poster that read:\\xa0“Last Day of Chemo.”\\xa0Grace—you are an inspiration to us all. Many childhood cancers have not seen new therapies in decades.\\xa0My budget will ask the Congress for $500 million over the next 10 years to fund this critical life-saving research. To help support working parents, the time has come to pass school choice for America’s children.\\xa0I am also proud to be the first President to include in my budget a plan for nationwide paid family leave—so that every new parent has the chance to bond with their newborn child. There could be no greater contrast to the beautiful image of a mother holding her infant child than the chilling displays our Nation saw in recent days.\\xa0Lawmakers in New York cheered with delight upon the passage of legislation that would allow a\\xa0baby to be ripped from the mother’s womb moments before birth.\\xa0These are living, feeling, beautiful babies who will never get the chance to share their love and dreams with the world.\\xa0And then, we had the case of the Governor of Virginia where he basically stated he would execute a baby after birth. To defend the dignity of every person, I am asking the Congress to pass legislation to prohibit the late-term abortion of children who can feel pain in the mother’s womb. Let us work together to build a culture that cherishes innocent life.\\xa0And let us reaffirm a fundamental truth:\\xa0all children—born and unborn— are made in the holy image of\\xa0God. The final part of my agenda is to protect America’s National Security. Over the last 2 years, we have begun to fully rebuild the\\xa0United States Military—with $700 billion last year and $716 billion this year.\\xa0We are also getting other nations to pay their fair share.\\xa0For years, the United States was being treated very unfairly by NATO—but now we have secured a $100\\xa0billion increase in defense spending from\\xa0NATO allies. As part of our military build-up, the United States is developing a state-of-the-art Missile Defense System. Under my administration, we will never apologize for advancing America’s interests. For example, decades ago the United States entered into a\\xa0treaty with Russia in which we agreed to limit and reduce our missile capabilities.\\xa0While we followed the agreement to the letter, Russia repeatedly violated its terms.\\xa0That is why I\\xa0announced that the United States is officially withdrawing from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, or INF Treaty. Perhaps we can negotiate a different agreement, adding China and others, or perhaps we can’t–-in which case, we will outspend and out-innovate all others by far. As part of a bold new diplomacy, we continue our historic push for peace on the Korean Peninsula.\\xa0Our hostages have come home, nuclear testing has stopped, and there has not been a missile launch in 15 months. If I had not been elected President of the United States, we would right now, in my opinion, be in a major war with North Korea with potentially millions of people killed.\\xa0Much work remains to be done, but my relationship with Kim Jong Un is a good one.\\xa0And Chairman Kim and I will meet again on February 27 and 28 in Vietnam. Two weeks ago, the United States officially recognized the legitimate government of Venezuela, and its new interim President, Juan Guaido. We stand with the Venezuelan people in their noble quest for freedom—and we condemn the brutality of the Maduro regime, whose socialist policies have turned that nation from being the wealthiest in South America into a state of abject poverty and despair. Here, in the United States, we are alarmed by new calls to adopt socialism in our country.\\xa0America was founded on liberty and independence–-not government coercion, domination, and control.\\xa0We are born free, and we will stay free.\\xa0Tonight, we\\xa0renew our resolve that America will never be a socialist country. One of the most complex set of challenges we face is in the Middle East. Our approach is based on principled realism—not discredited theories that have failed for decades to yield progress.\\xa0For this reason, my administration recognized the true capital of Israel—and proudly opened the American Embassy in Jerusalem. Our brave troops have now been fighting in the Middle East for almost 19 years.\\xa0In Afghanistan and Iraq, nearly 7,000 American heroes have given their lives.\\xa0More than 52,000 Americans have been badly wounded.\\xa0We have spent more than $7\\xa0trillion in the Middle East. As a candidate for President, I pledged a new approach. Great nations do not fight endless wars. When I took office, ISIS controlled more than 20,000 square miles in Iraq and Syria.\\xa0Today, we have liberated virtually all of that territory from the grip of these bloodthirsty killers. Now, as we work with our allies to destroy the remnants of ISIS, it is time to give our brave warriors in Syria a warm welcome home. I have also accelerated our negotiations to reach a political settlement in Afghanistan.\\xa0Our troops have fought with unmatched valor—and thanks to their bravery, we are now able to pursue a political solution to this long and bloody conflict. In Afghanistan, my administration is holding constructive talks with a number of Afghan groups, including the Taliban.\\xa0As we make progress in these negotiations, we will be able to reduce our troop presence and focus on counter-terrorism.\\xa0We do not know whether we will achieve an agreement—but we do know that after two decades of war, the hour has come to at least try for peace. Above all, friend and foe alike must never doubt this Nation’s power and will to defend our people.\\xa0Eighteen years ago, terrorists attacked the USS Cole—and last month American forces killed one of the leaders of the attack. We are honored to be joined tonight by Tom Wibberley, whose son, Navy Seaman Craig Wibberley, was one of the 17 sailors we tragically lost. Tom: we vow to always remember the heroes of the USS Cole. My administration has acted decisively to confront the world’s leading state sponsor of terror: the radical regime in Iran. To ensure this corrupt dictatorship never acquires nuclear weapons, I withdrew the United States from the disastrous Iran nuclear deal.\\xa0And last fall, we put in place the toughest sanctions ever imposed on a country. We will not avert our eyes from a regime that chants death to America and threatens genocide against the Jewish people.\\xa0We must never ignore the vile poison of anti-Semitism, or those who spread its venomous creed.\\xa0With one voice, we must confront this hatred anywhere and everywhere it occurs. Just months ago, 11 Jewish-Americans were viciously murdered in an anti-semitic attack on the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh.\\xa0SWAT Officer Timothy Matson raced into the gunfire and was shot seven times chasing down the killer.\\xa0Timothy has just had his 12th surgery—but he made the trip to\\xa0be here with us tonight.\\xa0Officer Matson: we are forever grateful for your courage in the face of evil. Tonight, we are also joined by Pittsburgh survivor Judah Samet.\\xa0He arrived at the synagogue as the massacre began. But not only did Judah narrowly escape death last fall—more than seven decades ago, he narrowly survived the Nazi concentration camps. Today is Judah’s 81st birthday.\\xa0Judah says he can still remember the exact moment, nearly 75 years ago, after 10 months in a concentration camp, when he and his family were put on a train, and told they were going to another camp.\\xa0Suddenly the train screeched to a halt.\\xa0A soldier appeared.\\xa0Judah’s family braced for the worst.\\xa0Then, his father cried out with joy: \\xa0“It’s the Americans.” A second Holocaust survivor who is here tonight, Joshua Kaufman, was a prisoner at Dachau Concentration Camp. He remembers watching through a hole in the wall of a cattle car as American soldiers rolled in with tanks.\\xa0“To me,” Joshua recalls, “the American soldiers were proof that God exists, and they came down from the sky.” I began this evening by honoring three soldiers who fought on D-Day in the Second World War. One of them was Herman Zeitchik.\\xa0But there is more to Herman’s story. A year after he stormed the beaches of Normandy, Herman was one of those American soldiers who helped liberate Dachau.\\xa0He was one of the Americans who helped rescue Joshua from that hell on\\xa0earth. Almost 75 years later, Herman and Joshua are both together in the gallery tonight—seated side-by-side, here in the home of American freedom.\\xa0Herman and Joshua:\\xa0your presence this evening honors and uplifts our entire Nation. When American soldiers set out beneath the dark skies over the English Channel in the early hours of D-Day, 1944, they were just young men of 18 and 19, hurtling on fragile landing craft toward the most momentous battle in the history of war. They did not know if they would survive the hour. They did not know if they would grow old.\\xa0But they knew that America had to prevail. Their cause was this Nation, and generations yet unborn. Why did they do it? They did it for America—they did it for us. Everything that has come since—our triumph over communism, our giant leaps of science and discovery, our unrivaled progress toward equality and justice—all of it is possible thanks to the blood and tears and courage and vision of the Americans who came before. Think of this Capitol—think of this very chamber, where lawmakers before you voted to end slavery, to build the railroads and the highways, to defeat fascism, to secure civil rights, to face down an evil empire. Here tonight, we have legislators from across this magnificent republic.\\xa0You have come from the rocky shores of Maine and the volcanic peaks of Hawaii; from the snowy woods of Wisconsin and the red deserts of Arizona; from the green farms of Kentucky and the golden beaches of California. Together, we represent the most extraordinary Nation in all of history. What will we do with this moment? How will we be remembered? I ask the men and women of this Congress:\\xa0Look at the opportunities before us!\\xa0Our most thrilling achievements are still ahead.\\xa0Our most exciting journeys still await.\\xa0Our biggest victories are still to come. We have not yet begun to\\xa0dream. We must choose whether we are defined by our differences—or whether we dare to transcend them. We must choose whether we will squander our inheritance—or whether we will proudly declare that we are Americans. We do the incredible.\\xa0We defy the impossible.\\xa0We conquer the unknown. This is the time to re-ignite the American imagination.\\xa0This is the time to search for the tallest summit\\xa0and set our sights on the brightest star. This is the time to rekindle the bonds of love and loyalty and memory that link us together as citizens, as neighbors, as patriots. This is our future—our fate—and our choice to make. I\\xa0am asking you to choose greatness. No matter the trials we face, no matter the challenges to come, we must go forward together. We must keep America first in our hearts.\\xa0We must keep freedom alive in our souls. And we must always keep faith in America’s destiny—that one Nation, under God, must be the hope and the promise and the light and the glory among all the nations of the world! Thank you. God Bless You, God Bless America, and good night!']"

       "'Madam Speaker, Mr. Vice President, Members of Congress, the\\xa0First Lady of the United States, and my fellow Americans: We meet tonight at a moment of unlimited potential.\\xa0As we begin a new Congress, I stand here ready to work with you to achieve historic breakthroughs for all Americans. Millions of our fellow citizens are watching us now, gathered in this great chamber, hoping that we will govern not as two parties but as one Nation. The agenda I will lay out this evening is not a Republican agenda or a Democrat agenda.\\xa0It is the agenda of the American people. Many of us campaigned on the same core promises:\\xa0to defend American jobs and demand fair trade for American workers; to rebuild and revitalize our Nation’s infrastructure; to reduce the price of healthcare and prescription drugs; to create an immigration system that is safe, lawful, modern, and secure; and to pursue a foreign policy that puts America’s interests first. There is a new opportunity in American politics, if only we have the courage to seize it.\\xa0Victory is not winning for our party.\\xa0Victory is winning for our country. This year, America will recognize two important anniversaries that show us the majesty of America’s mission, and\\xa0the power of American pride. In June, we mark 75 years since the start of what General Dwight D. Eisenhower called the Great Crusade—the Allied liberation of Europe in World War II.\\xa0On D-Day, June 6, 1944, 15,000 young American men jumped from the sky, and 60,000 more stormed in from the sea, to save our civilization from tyranny.\\xa0Here with us tonight are three of those heroes:\\xa0Private First Class Joseph Reilly, Staff Sergeant Irving Locker, and Sergeant Herman Zeitchik.\\xa0Gentlemen, we salute you. In 2019, we also celebrate 50 years since brave young pilots flew a quarter of a million miles through space to plant the American flag on the face of the moon.\\xa0Half a century later, we are joined by one of the Apollo 11 astronauts who planted that flag:\\xa0Buzz Aldrin. This year, American astronauts will go back to space on American rockets. In the 20th century, America saved freedom, transformed science, and redefined the middle class standard of living for the entire world to see.\\xa0Now, we must step boldly and bravely into the next chapter of this great American adventure, and we must create a new standard of living for the 21st century.\\xa0An amazing quality of life for all of our citizens is within our reach. We can make our communities safer, our families stronger, our culture richer, our faith deeper, and our middle class bigger and more prosperous than ever before. But we must reject the politics of revenge, resistance, and\\xa0retribution—and embrace the boundless potential of cooperation, compromise, and the common good. Together, we can break decades of political stalemate.\\xa0We can bridge old divisions, heal old wounds, build new coalitions, forge new solutions, and unlock the extraordinary promise of America’s future.\\xa0The decision is ours to make. We must choose between greatness or gridlock, results or resistance, vision or vengeance, incredible progress or pointless destruction. Tonight, I ask you to choose greatness. Over the last 2 years, my administration has moved with urgency and historic speed to confront problems neglected by leaders of both parties over many decades. In just over 2 years since the election, we have launched an unprecedented economic boom—a boom that has rarely been seen before.\\xa0We have created 5.3 million new jobs and importantly added 600,000 new manufacturing jobs—something which almost everyone said was impossible to do, but the fact is, we are just getting started. Wages are rising at the fastest pace in decades, and growing for blue collar workers, who I promised to fight for, faster than anyone else.\\xa0Nearly 5 million Americans have been lifted off food stamps.\\xa0The United States economy is growing almost twice as fast today as when I took office, and we are considered far and away the hottest economy anywhere in the world.\\xa0Unemployment has reached the lowest rate in half a century. African American, Hispanic American, and Asian American unemployment have all reached their lowest levels ever recorded. Unemployment for Americans with disabilities has also reached an all-time low.\\xa0More people are working now than at any time in our history–-157 million. We passed a massive tax cut for working families and doubled the child tax credit. We virtually ended the estate, or death, tax on small businesses, ranches, and family farms. We eliminated the very unpopular Obamacare individual mandate penalty—and to give critically ill patients access to life-saving cures, we passed right to try. My administration has cut more regulations in a short time than any other administration during its entire tenure.\\xa0Companies are coming back to our country in large numbers thanks to historic reductions in taxes and regulations. We have unleashed a revolution in American energy—the United States is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas in the world.\\xa0And now, for the first time in 65 years, we are a net exporter of energy. After 24 months of rapid progress, our economy is the envy of the world, our military is the most powerful on earth, and America is winning each and every day.\\xa0Members of Congress:\\xa0the State of our Union is strong.\\xa0Our country is vibrant and our economy is thriving like never before. On Friday, it was announced that we added another 304,000 jobs last month alone—almost double what was expected.\\xa0An economic miracle is taking place in the United States—and the\\xa0only thing that can stop it are foolish wars, politics, or ridiculous partisan investigations. If there is going to be peace and legislation, there cannot be war and investigation. It just doesn’t work that way! We must be united at home to defeat our adversaries abroad. This new era of cooperation can start with finally confirming the more than 300 highly qualified nominees who are still stuck in the Senate, some after years of waiting.\\xa0The Senate has failed to act on these nominations, which is unfair to the nominees and to our country. Now is the time for bipartisan action.\\xa0Believe it or not, we have already proven that it is possible. In the last Congress, both parties came together to pass unprecedented legislation to confront the opioid crisis, a sweeping new Farm Bill, historic VA reforms, and after four decades of rejection, we passed VA Accountability so we can finally terminate those who mistreat our wonderful veterans. And just weeks ago, both parties united for groundbreaking criminal justice reform.\\xa0Last year, I heard through friends the story of Alice Johnson.\\xa0I was deeply moved.\\xa0In 1997, Alice was sentenced to life in prison as a first-time non-violent drug offender.\\xa0Over the next two decades, she became a prison minister, inspiring others to choose a better path.\\xa0She had a\\xa0big impact on that prison population—and far beyond. Alice’s story underscores the disparities and unfairness that can exist in criminal sentencing—and the need to remedy this injustice.\\xa0She served almost 22 years and had expected to be in prison for the rest of her life. In June, I commuted Alice’s sentence, and she is here with us tonight.\\xa0Alice, thank you for reminding us that we always have the power to shape our own destiny. When I saw Alice’s beautiful family greet her at the prison gates, hugging and kissing and crying and laughing, I knew I did the right thing. Inspired by stories like Alice’s, my administration worked closely with members of both parties to sign the First Step Act into law.\\xa0This legislation reformed sentencing laws that have wrongly and disproportionately harmed the African American community.\\xa0The First Step Act gives non-violent offenders the chance to re-enter society as productive, law-abiding citizens. Now, States across the country are following our lead. America is a Nation that believes in redemption. We are also joined tonight by Matthew Charles from Tennessee.\\xa0In 1996, at age 30, Matthew was sentenced to 35 years for selling drugs and related offenses. Over the next two decades, he completed more than 30 Bible studies, became a law clerk, and mentored fellow inmates. Now, Matthew is the very first person to be released from prison under the First Step Act.\\xa0Matthew, on behalf of all Americans: welcome home. As we have seen, when we are united, we can make astonishing strides for our country.\\xa0Now, Republicans and Democrats must join forces again to confront an urgent national crisis. The Congress has 10 days left to pass a bill that will fund our government, protect our homeland, and secure our southern border. Now is the time for the Congress to show the world that America is committed to ending illegal immigration and putting the ruthless coyotes, cartels, drug dealers, and human traffickers out of business. As we speak, large, organized caravans are on the march to the United States.\\xa0We have just heard that Mexican cities, in order to remove the illegal immigrants from their communities, are getting trucks and buses to bring them up to our country in areas where there is little border protection.\\xa0I have ordered another 3,750 troops to our southern border to prepare for the tremendous onslaught. This is a moral issue.\\xa0The lawless state of our southern border is a threat to the safety, security, and financial well‑being of all Americans.\\xa0We have a moral duty to create an\\xa0immigration system that protects the lives and jobs of our citizens.\\xa0This includes our obligation to the millions of immigrants living here today, who followed the rules and respected our laws. Legal immigrants enrich our Nation and strengthen our society in countless ways.\\xa0I want people to come into our country, but they have to come in legally. Tonight, I am asking you to defend our very dangerous southern border out of love and devotion to our fellow citizens and to our country. No issue better illustrates the divide between America’s working class and America’s political class than illegal immigration.\\xa0Wealthy politicians and donors push for open borders while living their lives behind walls and gates and guards. Meanwhile, working class Americans are left to pay the price for mass illegal migration—reduced jobs, lower wages, overburdened schools and hospitals, increased crime, and a\\xa0depleted social safety net. Tolerance for illegal immigration is not compassionate—it is cruel.\\xa0One in three women is sexually assaulted on the long journey north. Smugglers use migrant children as human pawns to exploit our laws and gain access to our country. Human traffickers and sex traffickers take advantage of the wide open areas between our ports of entry to\\xa0smuggle thousands of young girls and women into the United\\xa0States and to sell them into prostitution and modern-day slavery. Tens of thousands of innocent Americans are killed by lethal drugs that cross our border and flood into our cities—including meth, heroin, cocaine, and fentanyl. The savage gang, MS-13, now operates in 20 different American states, and they almost all come through our southern border.\\xa0Just yesterday, an MS-13 gang member was taken into custody for a fatal shooting on a subway platform in New York City.\\xa0We are removing these gang members by the thousands, but until we secure our border they’re going to keep streaming back\\xa0in. Year after year, countless Americans are murdered by criminal illegal aliens. I’ve gotten to know many wonderful Angel Moms, Dads, and families—no one should ever have to suffer the horrible heartache they have endured. Here tonight is Debra Bissell.\\xa0Just three weeks ago, Debra’s parents, Gerald and Sharon, were burglarized and shot to\\xa0death in their Reno, Nevada, home by an illegal alien. They\\xa0were in their eighties and are survived by four children, 11\\xa0grandchildren, and 20 great-grandchildren. Also here tonight are Gerald and Sharon’s granddaughter, Heather, and great‑granddaughter, Madison. To Debra, Heather, Madison, please stand: few can understand your pain.\\xa0But I will never forget, and I will fight for the memory of Gerald and Sharon, that it should never happen again. Not one more American life should be lost because our Nation failed to control its very dangerous border. In the last 2 years, our brave ICE officers made 266,000 arrests of criminal aliens, including those charged or convicted of nearly 100,000 assaults, 30,000 sex crimes, and 4,000 killings. We are joined tonight by one of those law enforcement heroes:\\xa0ICE Special Agent Elvin Hernandez.\\xa0When Elvin was a boy, he and his family legally immigrated to the United States from the Dominican Republic.\\xa0At the age of eight, Elvin told his dad he wanted to become a Special Agent.\\xa0Today, he leads investigations into the scourge of international sex trafficking.\\xa0Elvin says: \\xa0“If I can make sure these young girls get their justice, I’ve done my job.”\\xa0Thanks to his work and that of his colleagues, more than 300 women and girls have been rescued from horror, and more than 1,500 sadistic traffickers have been put behind bars in the last year. Special Agent Hernandez, please stand:\\xa0We will always support the brave men and women of Law Enforcement—and I pledge to you tonight that we will never abolish our heroes from ICE. My administration has sent to the Congress a commonsense proposal to end the crisis on our southern border. It includes humanitarian assistance, more law enforcement, drug detection at our ports, closing loopholes that enable child smuggling, and plans for a new physical barrier, or wall, to secure the vast areas between our ports of entry.\\xa0In the past, most of the people in this room voted for a wall—but the proper wall never got built. I’ll get it built. This is a smart, strategic, see-through steel barrier—not just a simple concrete wall. It will be deployed in the areas identified by border agents as having the greatest need, and as these agents will tell you, where walls go up, illegal crossings go way down. San Diego used to have the most illegal border crossings in the country.\\xa0In response, and at the request of San Diego residents and political leaders, a strong security wall was put in place.\\xa0This powerful barrier almost completely ended illegal crossings. The border city of El Paso, Texas, used to have extremely high rates of violent crime—one of the highest in the country, and considered one of our Nation’s most dangerous cities.\\xa0Now, with a powerful barrier in place, El Paso is one\\xa0of our safest cities. Simply put, walls work and walls save lives.\\xa0So let’s work together, compromise, and reach a deal that will truly make America safe. As we work to defend our people’s safety, we must also ensure our economic resurgence continues at a rapid pace. No one has benefitted more from our thriving economy than women, who have filled 58 percent of the new jobs created in the last year. All Americans can be proud that we have more women in the workforce than ever before—and exactly one century after the Congress passed the Constitutional amendment giving women the right to vote, we also have more women serving in the Congress than ever before. As part of our commitment to improving opportunity for women everywhere, this Thursday we are launching the first ever Government-wide initiative focused on economic empowerment for women in developing countries. To build on our incredible economic success, one priority is paramount—reversing decades of calamitous trade policies. We are now making it clear to China that after years of targeting our industries\\xa0and stealing our intellectual property, the theft of\\xa0American jobs and wealth has come to an end. Therefore, we recently imposed tariffs on $250 billion of Chinese goods—and now our Treasury is receiving billions of dollars a month from a country that never gave us a\\xa0dime.\\xa0But I\\xa0don’t blame China for taking advantage of us—I\\xa0blame our leaders and representatives for allowing this travesty to happen.\\xa0I have great respect for President Xi, and we are now working on a new trade deal with China.\\xa0But it must include real, structural change to end unfair trade practices, reduce our chronic trade deficit, and protect American jobs. Another historic trade blunder was the catastrophe known as NAFTA. I have met the men and women of Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Indiana, New Hampshire, and many other states whose dreams were shattered by NAFTA.\\xa0For years, politicians promised them they would negotiate for a better deal. But no one ever tried—until now. Our new U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement—or USMCA—will replace NAFTA and deliver for American workers:\\xa0bringing back\\xa0our manufacturing jobs, expanding American agriculture, protecting intellectual property, and ensuring that more cars are proudly stamped with four beautiful words:\\xa0made in the USA. Tonight, I am also asking you to pass the United States Reciprocal Trade Act, so that if another country places an unfair tariff on an American product, we can charge them the exact same tariff on the same product that they sell to us. Both parties should be able to unite for a great rebuilding of America’s crumbling infrastructure. I know that the Congress is eager to pass an infrastructure bill—and I am eager to work with you on legislation to deliver new and important infrastructure investment, including investments in the cutting edge industries of the future.\\xa0This is not an option.\\xa0This is a necessity. The next major priority for me, and for all of us, should be to lower the cost of healthcare and prescription drugs—and to protect patients with pre-existing conditions. Already, as a result of my administration’s efforts, in 2018 drug prices experienced their single largest decline in 46\\xa0years. But we must do more.\\xa0It is unacceptable that Americans pay vastly more than people in other countries for the exact same drugs, often made in the exact same place.\\xa0This is wrong, unfair, and together we can stop it. I am asking the Congress to pass legislation that finally takes on the problem of global freeloading and delivers fairness and price transparency for American patients. We should also require drug companies, insurance companies, and hospitals to disclose real prices to foster competition and bring costs down. No force in history has done more to advance the human condition than American freedom.\\xa0In recent years we have made remarkable progress in the fight against HIV and AIDS.\\xa0Scientific breakthroughs have brought a once-distant dream within reach.\\xa0My budget will ask Democrats and Republicans to make the needed commitment to eliminate the HIV epidemic in the United States within 10 years.\\xa0Together, we will defeat AIDS in\\xa0America. Tonight, I am also asking you to join me in another fight that all Americans can get behind:\\xa0the fight against childhood cancer. Joining Melania in the gallery this evening is a very brave 10-year-old girl, Grace Eline. Every birthday since she was 4, Grace asked her friends to donate to St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital.\\xa0She did not know that one day she might be a\\xa0patient herself.\\xa0Last year, Grace was diagnosed with brain cancer.\\xa0Immediately, she began radiation treatment.\\xa0At the same time, she rallied her community and raised more than $40,000 for the fight against cancer. When Grace completed treatment last fall, her doctors and nurses cheered with tears in their eyes as she hung up a poster that read:\\xa0“Last Day of Chemo.”\\xa0Grace—you are an inspiration to us all. Many childhood cancers have not seen new therapies in decades.\\xa0My budget will ask the Congress for $500 million over the next 10 years to fund this critical life-saving research. To help support working parents, the time has come to pass school choice for America’s children.\\xa0I am also proud to be the first President to include in my budget a plan for nationwide paid family leave—so that every new parent has the chance to bond with their newborn child. There could be no greater contrast to the beautiful image of a mother holding her infant child than the chilling displays our Nation saw in recent days.\\xa0Lawmakers in New York cheered with delight upon the passage of legislation that would allow a\\xa0baby to be ripped from the mother’s womb moments before birth.\\xa0These are living, feeling, beautiful babies who will never get the chance to share their love and dreams with the world.\\xa0And then, we had the case of the Governor of Virginia where he basically stated he would execute a baby after birth. To defend the dignity of every person, I am asking the Congress to pass legislation to prohibit the late-term abortion of children who can feel pain in the mother’s womb. Let us work together to build a culture that cherishes innocent life.\\xa0And let us reaffirm a fundamental truth:\\xa0all children—born and unborn— are made in the holy image of\\xa0God. The final part of my agenda is to protect America’s National Security. Over the last 2 years, we have begun to fully rebuild the\\xa0United States Military—with $700 billion last year and $716 billion this year.\\xa0We are also getting other nations to pay their fair share.\\xa0For years, the United States was being treated very unfairly by NATO—but now we have secured a $100\\xa0billion increase in defense spending from\\xa0NATO allies. As part of our military build-up, the United States is developing a state-of-the-art Missile Defense System. Under my administration, we will never apologize for advancing America’s interests. For example, decades ago the United States entered into a\\xa0treaty with Russia in which we agreed to limit and reduce our missile capabilities.\\xa0While we followed the agreement to the letter, Russia repeatedly violated its terms.\\xa0That is why I\\xa0announced that the United States is officially withdrawing from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, or INF Treaty. Perhaps we can negotiate a different agreement, adding China and others, or perhaps we can’t–-in which case, we will outspend and out-innovate all others by far. As part of a bold new diplomacy, we continue our historic push for peace on the Korean Peninsula.\\xa0Our hostages have come home, nuclear testing has stopped, and there has not been a missile launch in 15 months. If I had not been elected President of the United States, we would right now, in my opinion, be in a major war with North Korea with potentially millions of people killed.\\xa0Much work remains to be done, but my relationship with Kim Jong Un is a good one.\\xa0And Chairman Kim and I will meet again on February 27 and 28 in Vietnam. Two weeks ago, the United States officially recognized the legitimate government of Venezuela, and its new interim President, Juan Guaido. We stand with the Venezuelan people in their noble quest for freedom—and we condemn the brutality of the Maduro regime, whose socialist policies have turned that nation from being the wealthiest in South America into a state of abject poverty and despair. Here, in the United States, we are alarmed by new calls to adopt socialism in our country.\\xa0America was founded on liberty and independence–-not government coercion, domination, and control.\\xa0We are born free, and we will stay free.\\xa0Tonight, we\\xa0renew our resolve that America will never be a socialist country. One of the most complex set of challenges we face is in the Middle East. Our approach is based on principled realism—not discredited theories that have failed for decades to yield progress.\\xa0For this reason, my administration recognized the true capital of Israel—and proudly opened the American Embassy in Jerusalem. Our brave troops have now been fighting in the Middle East for almost 19 years.\\xa0In Afghanistan and Iraq, nearly 7,000 American heroes have given their lives.\\xa0More than 52,000 Americans have been badly wounded.\\xa0We have spent more than $7\\xa0trillion in the Middle East. As a candidate for President, I pledged a new approach. Great nations do not fight endless wars. When I took office, ISIS controlled more than 20,000 square miles in Iraq and Syria.\\xa0Today, we have liberated virtually all of that territory from the grip of these bloodthirsty killers. Now, as we work with our allies to destroy the remnants of ISIS, it is time to give our brave warriors in Syria a warm welcome home. I have also accelerated our negotiations to reach a political settlement in Afghanistan.\\xa0Our troops have fought with unmatched valor—and thanks to their bravery, we are now able to pursue a political solution to this long and bloody conflict. In Afghanistan, my administration is holding constructive talks with a number of Afghan groups, including the Taliban.\\xa0As we make progress in these negotiations, we will be able to reduce our troop presence and focus on counter-terrorism.\\xa0We do not know whether we will achieve an agreement—but we do know that after two decades of war, the hour has come to at least try for peace. Above all, friend and foe alike must never doubt this Nation’s power and will to defend our people.\\xa0Eighteen years ago, terrorists attacked the USS Cole—and last month American forces killed one of the leaders of the attack. We are honored to be joined tonight by Tom Wibberley, whose son, Navy Seaman Craig Wibberley, was one of the 17 sailors we tragically lost. Tom: we vow to always remember the heroes of the USS Cole. My administration has acted decisively to confront the world’s leading state sponsor of terror: the radical regime in Iran. To ensure this corrupt dictatorship never acquires nuclear weapons, I withdrew the United States from the disastrous Iran nuclear deal.\\xa0And last fall, we put in place the toughest sanctions ever imposed on a country. We will not avert our eyes from a regime that chants death to America and threatens genocide against the Jewish people.\\xa0We must never ignore the vile poison of anti-Semitism, or those who spread its venomous creed.\\xa0With one voice, we must confront this hatred anywhere and everywhere it occurs. Just months ago, 11 Jewish-Americans were viciously murdered in an anti-semitic attack on the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh.\\xa0SWAT Officer Timothy Matson raced into the gunfire and was shot seven times chasing down the killer.\\xa0Timothy has just had his 12th surgery—but he made the trip to\\xa0be here with us tonight.\\xa0Officer Matson: we are forever grateful for your courage in the face of evil. Tonight, we are also joined by Pittsburgh survivor Judah Samet.\\xa0He arrived at the synagogue as the massacre began. But not only did Judah narrowly escape death last fall—more than seven decades ago, he narrowly survived the Nazi concentration camps. Today is Judah’s 81st birthday.\\xa0Judah says he can still remember the exact moment, nearly 75 years ago, after 10 months in a concentration camp, when he and his family were put on a train, and told they were going to another camp.\\xa0Suddenly the train screeched to a halt.\\xa0A soldier appeared.\\xa0Judah’s family braced for the worst.\\xa0Then, his father cried out with joy: \\xa0“It’s the Americans.” A second Holocaust survivor who is here tonight, Joshua Kaufman, was a prisoner at Dachau Concentration Camp. He remembers watching through a hole in the wall of a cattle car as American soldiers rolled in with tanks.\\xa0“To me,” Joshua recalls, “the American soldiers were proof that God exists, and they came down from the sky.” I began this evening by honoring three soldiers who fought on D-Day in the Second World War. One of them was Herman Zeitchik.\\xa0But there is more to Herman’s story. A year after he stormed the beaches of Normandy, Herman was one of those American soldiers who helped liberate Dachau.\\xa0He was one of the Americans who helped rescue Joshua from that hell on\\xa0earth. Almost 75 years later, Herman and Joshua are both together in the gallery tonight—seated side-by-side, here in the home of American freedom.\\xa0Herman and Joshua:\\xa0your presence this evening honors and uplifts our entire Nation. When American soldiers set out beneath the dark skies over the English Channel in the early hours of D-Day, 1944, they were just young men of 18 and 19, hurtling on fragile landing craft toward the most momentous battle in the history of war. They did not know if they would survive the hour. They did not know if they would grow old.\\xa0But they knew that America had to prevail. Their cause was this Nation, and generations yet unborn. Why did they do it? They did it for America—they did it for us. Everything that has come since—our triumph over communism, our giant leaps of science and discovery, our unrivaled progress toward equality and justice—all of it is possible thanks to the blood and tears and courage and vision of the Americans who came before. Think of this Capitol—think of this very chamber, where lawmakers before you voted to end slavery, to build the railroads and the highways, to defeat fascism, to secure civil rights, to face down an evil empire. Here tonight, we have legislators from across this magnificent republic.\\xa0You have come from the rocky shores of Maine and the volcanic peaks of Hawaii; from the snowy woods of Wisconsin and the red deserts of Arizona; from the green farms of Kentucky and the golden beaches of California. Together, we represent the most extraordinary Nation in all of history. What will we do with this moment? How will we be remembered? I ask the men and women of this Congress:\\xa0Look at the opportunities before us!\\xa0Our most thrilling achievements are still ahead.\\xa0Our most exciting journeys still await.\\xa0Our biggest victories are still to come. We have not yet begun to\\xa0dream. We must choose whether we are defined by our differences—or whether we dare to transcend them. We must choose whether we will squander our inheritance—or whether we will proudly declare that we are Americans. We do the incredible.\\xa0We defy the impossible.\\xa0We conquer the unknown. This is the time to re-ignite the American imagination.\\xa0This is the time to search for the tallest summit\\xa0and set our sights on the brightest star. This is the time to rekindle the bonds of love and loyalty and memory that link us together as citizens, as neighbors, as patriots. This is our future—our fate—and our choice to make. I\\xa0am asking you to choose greatness. No matter the trials we face, no matter the challenges to come, we must go forward together. We must keep America first in our hearts.\\xa0We must keep freedom alive in our souls. And we must always keep faith in America’s destiny—that one Nation, under God, must be the hope and the promise and the light and the glory among all the nations of the world! Thank you. God Bless You, God Bless America, and good night!'"

the same core promises\\xa0to defend american jobs and demand fair trade for american workers to rebuild and revitalize our nation’s infrastructure to reduce the price of healthcare and prescription drugs to create an immigration system that is safe lawful modern and secure and to pursue a foreign policy that puts america’s interests first there is a new opportunity in american politics if only we have the courage to seize it\\xa0victory is not winning for our party\\xa0victory is winning for our country this year america will recognize two important anniversaries that show us the majesty of america’s mission and\\xa0the power of american pride in june we mark  years since the start of what general dwight d eisenhower called the great crusade—the allied liberation of europe in world war ii\\xa0on dday june    young american men jumped from the sky and  more stormed in from the sea to save our civilization from tyranny\\xa0here with us tonight are three of those heroes\\xa0private first class joseph reilly staff sergeant irving locker and sergeant herman zeitchik\\xa0gentlemen we salute you in  we also celebrate  years since brave young pilots flew a quarter of a million miles through space to plant the american flag on the face of the moon\\xa0half a century later we are joined by one of the apollo  astronauts who planted that flag\\xa0buzz aldrin this year american astronauts will go back to space on american rockets in the  century america saved freedom transformed science and redefined the middle class standard of living for the entire world to see\\xa0now we must step boldly and bravely into the next chapter of this great american adventure and we must create a new standard of living for the  century\\xa0an amazing quality of life for all of our citizens is within our reach we can make our communities safer our families stronger our culture richer our faith deeper and our middle class bigger and more prosperous than ever before but we must reject the politics of revenge resistance and\\xa0retribution—and embrace the boundless potential of cooperation compromise and the common good together we can break decades of political stalemate\\xa0we can bridge old divisions heal old wounds build new coalitions forge new solutions and unlock the extraordinary promise of america’s future\\xa0the decision is ours to make we must choose between greatness or gridlock results or resistance vision or vengeance incredible progress or pointless destruction tonight i ask you to choose greatness over the last  years my administration has moved with urgency and historic speed to confront problems neglected by leaders of both parties over many decades in just over  years since the election we have launched an unprecedented economic boom—a boom that has rarely been seen before\\xa0we have created  million new jobs and importantly added  new manufacturing jobs—something which almost everyone said was impossible to do but the fact is we are just getting started wages are rising at the fastest pace in decades and growing for blue collar workers who i promised to fight for faster than anyone else\\xa0nearly  million americans have been lifted off food stamps\\xa0the united states economy is growing almost twice as fast today as when i took office and we are considered far and away the hottest economy anywhere in the world\\xa0unemployment has reached the lowest rate in half a century african american hispanic american and asian american unemployment have all reached their lowest levels ever recorded unemployment for americans with disabilities has also reached an alltime low\\xa0more people are working now than at any time in our history– million we passed a massive tax cut for working families and doubled the child tax credit we virtually ended the estate or death tax on small businesses ranches and family farms we eliminated the very unpopular obamacare individual mandate penalty—and to give critically ill patients access to lifesaving cures we passed right to try my administration has cut more regulations in a short time than any other administration during its entire tenure\\xa0companies are coming back to our country in large numbers thanks to historic reductions in taxes and regulations we have unleashed a revolution in american energy—the united states is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas in the world\\xa0and now for the first time in  years we are a net exporter of energy after  months of rapid progress our economy is the envy of the world our military is the most powerful on earth and america is winning each and every day\\xa0members of congress\\xa0the state of our union is strong\\xa0our country is vibrant and our economy is thriving like never before on friday it was announced that we added another  jobs last month alone—almost double what was expected\\xa0an economic miracle is taking place in the united states—and the\\xa0only thing that can stop it are foolish wars politics or ridiculous partisan investigations if there is going to be peace and legislation there cannot be war and investigation it just doesn’t work that way we must be united at home to defeat our adversaries abroad this new era of cooperation can start with finally confirming the more than  highly qualified nominees who are still stuck in the senate some after years of waiting\\xa0the senate has failed to act on these nominations which is unfair to the nominees and to our country now is the time for bipartisan action\\xa0believe it or not we have already proven that it is possible in the last congress both parties came together to pass unprecedented legislation to confront the opioid crisis a sweeping new farm bill historic va reforms and after four decades of rejection we passed va accountability so we can finally terminate those who mistreat our wonderful veterans and just weeks ago both parties united for groundbreaking criminal justice reform\\xa0last year i heard through friends the story of alice johnson\\xa0i was deeply moved\\xa0in  alice was sentenced to life in prison as a firsttime nonviolent drug offender\\xa0over the next two decades she became a prison minister inspiring others to choose a better path\\xa0she had a\\xa0big impact on that prison population—and far beyond alice’s story underscores the disparities and unfairness that can exist in criminal sentencing—and the need to remedy this injustice\\xa0she served almost  years and had expected to be in prison for the rest of her life in june i commuted alice’s sentence and she is here with us tonight\\xa0alice thank you for reminding us that we always have the power to shape our own destiny when i saw alice’s beautiful family greet her at the prison gates hugging and kissing and crying and laughing i knew i did the right thing inspired by stories like alice’s my administration worked closely with members of both parties to sign the first step act into law\\xa0this legislation reformed sentencing laws that have wrongly and disproportionately harmed the african american community\\xa0the first step act gives nonviolent offenders the chance to reenter society as productive lawabiding citizens now states across the country are following our lead america is a nation that believes in redemption we are also joined tonight by matthew charles from tennessee\\xa0in  at age  matthew was sentenced to  years for selling drugs and related offenses over the next two decades he completed more than  bible studies became a law clerk and mentored fellow inmates now matthew is the very first person to be released from prison under the first step act\\xa0matthew on behalf of all americans welcome home as we have seen when we are united we can make astonishing strides for our country\\xa0now republicans and democrats must join forces again to confront an urgent national crisis the congress has  days left to pass a bill that will fund our government protect our homeland and secure our southern border now is the time for the congress to show the world that america is committed to ending illegal immigration and putting the ruthless coyotes cartels drug dealers and human traffickers out of business as we speak large organized caravans are on the march to the united states\\xa0we have just heard that mexican cities in order to remove the illegal immigrants from their communities are getting trucks and buses to bring them up to our country in areas where there is little border protection\\xa0i have ordered another  troops to our southern border to prepare for the tremendous onslaught this is a moral issue\\xa0the lawless state of our southern border is a threat to the safety security and financial well‑being of all americans\\xa0we have a moral duty to create an\\xa0immigration system that protects the lives and jobs of our citizens\\xa0this includes our obligation to the millions of immigrants living here today who followed the rules and respected our laws legal immigrants enrich our nation and strengthen our society in countless ways\\xa0i want people to come into our country but they have to come in legally tonight i am asking you to defend our very dangerous southern border out of love and devotion to our fellow citizens and to our country no issue better illustrates the divide between america’s working class and america’s political class than illegal immigration\\xa0wealthy politicians and donors push for open borders while living their lives behind walls and gates and guards meanwhile working class americans are left to pay the price for mass illegal migration—reduced jobs lower wages overburdened schools and hospitals increased crime and a\\xa0depleted social safety net tolerance for illegal immigration is not compassionate—it is cruel\\xa0one in three women is sexually assaulted on the long journey north smugglers use migrant children as human pawns to exploit our laws and gain access to our country human traffickers and sex traffickers take advantage of the wide open areas between our ports of entry to\\xa0smuggle thousands of young girls and women into the united\\xa0states and to sell them into prostitution and modernday slavery tens of thousands of innocent americans are killed by lethal drugs that cross our border and flood into our cities—including meth heroin cocaine and fentanyl the savage gang  now operates in  different american states and they almost all come through our southern border\\xa0just yesterday an  gang member was taken into custody for a fatal shooting on a subway platform in new york city\\xa0we are removing these gang members by the thousands but until we secure our border they’re going to keep streaming back\\xa0in year after year countless americans are murdered by criminal illegal aliens i’ve gotten to know many wonderful angel moms dads and families—no one should ever have to suffer the horrible heartache they have endured here tonight is debra bissell\\xa0just three weeks ago debra’s parents gerald and sharon were burglarized and shot to\\xa0death in their reno nevada home by an illegal alien they\\xa0were in their eighties and are survived by four children \\xa0grandchildren and  greatgrandchildren also here tonight are gerald and sharon’s granddaughter heather and great‑granddaughter madison to debra heather madison please stand few can understand your pain\\xa0but i will never forget and i will fight for the memory of gerald and sharon that it should never happen again not one more american life should be lost because our nation failed to control its very dangerous border in the last  years our brave ice officers made  arrests of criminal aliens including those charged or convicted of nearly  assaults  sex crimes and  killings we are joined tonight by one of those law enforcement heroes\\xa0ice special agent elvin hernandez\\xa0when elvin was a boy he and his family legally immigrated to the united states from the dominican republic\\xa0at the age of eight elvin told his dad he wanted to become a special agent\\xa0today he leads investigations into the scourge of international sex trafficking\\xa0elvin says \\xa0“if i can make sure these young girls get their justice i’ve done my job”\\xa0thanks to his work and that of his colleagues more than  women and girls have been rescued from horror and more than  sadistic traffickers have been put behind bars in the last year special agent hernandez please stand\\xa0we will always support the brave men and women of law enforcement—and i pledge to you tonight that we will never abolish our heroes from ice my administration has sent to the congress a commonsense proposal to end the crisis on our southern border it includes humanitarian assistance more law enforcement drug detection at our ports closing loopholes that enable child smuggling and plans for a new physical barrier or wall to secure the vast areas between our ports of entry\\xa0in the past most of the people in this room voted for a wall—but the proper wall never got built i’ll get it built this is a smart strategic seethrough steel barrier—not just a simple concrete wall it will be deployed in the areas identified by border agents as having the greatest need and as these agents will tell you where walls go up illegal crossings go way down san diego used to have the most illegal border crossings in the country\\xa0in response and at the request of san diego residents and political leaders a strong security wall was put in place\\xa0this powerful barrier almost completely ended illegal crossings the border city of el paso texas used to have extremely high rates of violent crime—one of the highest in the country and considered one of our nation’s most dangerous cities\\xa0now with a powerful barrier in place el paso is one\\xa0of our safest cities simply put walls work and walls save lives\\xa0so let’s work together compromise and reach a deal that will truly make america safe as we work to defend our people’s safety we must also ensure our economic resurgence continues at a rapid pace no one has benefitted more from our thriving economy than women who have filled  percent of the new jobs created in the last year all americans can be proud that we have more women in the workforce than ever before—and exactly one century after the congress passed the constitutional amendment giving women the right to vote we also have more women serving in the congress than ever before as part of our commitment to improving opportunity for women everywhere this thursday we are launching the first ever governmentwide initiative focused on economic empowerment for women in developing countries to build on our incredible economic success one priority is paramount—reversing decades of calamitous trade policies we are now making it clear to china that after years of targeting our industries\\xa0and stealing our intellectual property the theft of\\xa0american jobs and wealth has come to an end therefore we recently imposed tariffs on  billion of chinese goods—and now our treasury is receiving billions of dollars a month from a country that never gave us a\\xa0dime\\xa0but i\\xa0don’t blame china for taking advantage of us—i\\xa0blame our leaders and representatives for allowing this travesty to happen\\xa0i have great respect for president xi and we are now working on a new trade deal with china\\xa0but it must include real structural change to end unfair trade practices reduce our chronic trade deficit and protect american jobs another historic trade blunder was the catastrophe known as nafta i have met the men and women of michigan ohio pennsylvania indiana new hampshire and many other states whose dreams were shattered by nafta\\xa0for years politicians promised them they would negotiate for a better deal but no one ever tried—until now our new usmexicocanada agreement—or usmca—will replace nafta and deliver for american workers\\xa0bringing back\\xa0our manufacturing jobs expanding american agriculture protecting intellectual property and ensuring that more cars are proudly stamped with four beautiful words\\xa0made in the usa tonight i am also asking you to pass the united states reciprocal trade act so that if another country places an unfair tariff on an american product we can charge them the exact same tariff on the same product that they sell to us both parties should be able to unite for a great rebuilding of america’s crumbling infrastructure i know that the congress is eager to pass an infrastructure bill—and i am eager to work with you on legislation to deliver new and important infrastructure investment including investments in the cutting edge industries of the future\\xa0this is not an option\\xa0this is a necessity the next major priority for me and for all of us should be to lower the cost of healthcare and prescription drugs—and to protect patients with preexisting conditions already as a result of my administration’s efforts in  drug prices experienced their single largest decline in \\xa0years but we must do more\\xa0it is unacceptable that americans pay vastly more than people in other countries for the exact same drugs often made in the exact same place\\xa0this is wrong unfair and together we can stop it i am asking the congress to pass legislation that finally takes on the problem of global freeloading and delivers fairness and price transparency for american patients we should also require drug companies insurance companies and hospitals to disclose real prices to foster competition and bring costs down no force in history has done more to advance the human condition than american freedom\\xa0in recent years we have made remarkable progress in the fight against hiv and aids\\xa0scientific breakthroughs have brought a oncedistant dream within reach\\xa0my budget will ask democrats and republicans to make the needed commitment to eliminate the hiv epidemic in the united states within  years\\xa0together we will defeat aids in\\xa0america tonight i am also asking you to join me in another fight that all americans can get behind\\xa0the fight against childhood cancer joining melania in the gallery this evening is a very brave  girl grace eline every birthday since she was  grace asked her friends to donate to st jude children’s research hospital\\xa0she did not know that one day she might be a\\xa0patient herself\\xa0last year grace was diagnosed with brain cancer\\xa0immediately she began radiation treatment\\xa0at the same time she rallied her community and raised more than  for the fight against cancer when grace completed treatment last fall her doctors and nurses cheered with tears in their eyes as she hung up a poster that read\\xa0“last day of chemo”\\xa0grace—you are an inspiration to us all many childhood cancers have not seen new therapies in decades\\xa0my budget will ask the congress for  million over the next  years to fund this critical lifesaving research to help support working parents the time has come to pass school choice for america’s children\\xa0i am also proud to be the first president to include in my budget a plan for nationwide paid family leave—so that every new parent has the chance to bond with their newborn child there could be no greater contrast to the beautiful image of a mother holding her infant child than the chilling displays our nation saw in recent days\\xa0lawmakers in new york cheered with delight upon the passage of legislation that would allow a\\xa0baby to be ripped from the mother’s womb moments before birth\\xa0these are living feeling beautiful babies who will never get the chance to share their love and dreams with the world\\xa0and then we had the case of the governor of virginia where he basically stated he would execute a baby after birth to defend the dignity of every person i am asking the congress to pass legislation to prohibit the lateterm abortion of children who can feel pain in the mother’s womb let us work together to build a culture that cherishes innocent life\\xa0and let us reaffirm a fundamental truth\\xa0all children—born and unborn— are made in the holy image of\\xa0god the final part of my agenda is to protect america’s national security over the last  years we have begun to fully rebuild the\\xa0united states military—with  billion last year and  billion this year\\xa0we are also getting other nations to pay their fair share\\xa0for years the united states was being treated very unfairly by nato—but now we have secured a \\xa0billion increase in defense spending from\\xa0nato allies as part of our military buildup the united states is developing a stateoftheart missile defense system under my administration we will never apologize for advancing america’s interests for example decades ago the united states entered into a\\xa0treaty with russia in which we agreed to limit and reduce our missile capabilities\\xa0while we followed the agreement to the letter russia repeatedly violated its terms\\xa0that is why i\\xa0announced that the united states is officially withdrawing from the intermediaterange nuclear forces treaty or inf treaty perhaps we can negotiate a different agreement adding china and others or perhaps we can’t–in which case we will outspend and outinnovate all others by far as part of a bold new diplomacy we continue our historic push for peace on the korean peninsula\\xa0our hostages have come home nuclear testing has stopped and there has not been a missile launch in  months if i had not been elected president of the united states we would right now in my opinion be in a major war with north korea with potentially millions of people killed\\xa0much work remains to be done but my relationship with kim jong un is a good one\\xa0and chairman kim and i will meet again on february  and  in vietnam two weeks ago the united states officially recognized the legitimate government of venezuela and its new interim president juan guaido we stand with the venezuelan people in their noble quest for freedom—and we condemn the brutality of the maduro regime whose socialist policies have turned that nation from being the wealthiest in south america into a state of abject poverty and despair here in the united states we are alarmed by new calls to adopt socialism in our country\\xa0america was founded on liberty and independence–not government coercion domination and control\\xa0we are born free and we will stay free\\xa0tonight we\\xa0renew our resolve that america will never be a socialist country one of the most complex set of challenges we face is in the middle east our approach is based on principled realism—not discredited theories that have failed for decades to yield progress\\xa0for this reason my administration recognized the true capital of israel—and proudly opened the american embassy in jerusalem our brave troops have now been fighting in the middle east for almost  years\\xa0in afghanistan and iraq nearly  american heroes have given their lives\\xa0more than  americans have been badly wounded\\xa0we have spent more than \\xa0trillion in the middle east as a candidate for president i pledged a new approach great nations do not fight endless wars when i took office isis controlled more than  square miles in iraq and syria\\xa0today we have liberated virtually all of that territory from the grip of these bloodthirsty killers now as we work with our allies to destroy the remnants of isis it is time to give our brave warriors in syria a warm welcome home i have also accelerated our negotiations to reach a political settlement in afghanistan\\xa0our troops have fought with unmatched valor—and thanks to their bravery we are now able to pursue a political solution to this long and bloody conflict in afghanistan my administration is holding constructive talks with a number of afghan groups including the taliban\\xa0as we make progress in these negotiations we will be able to reduce our troop presence and focus on counterterrorism\\xa0we do not know whether we will achieve an agreement—but we do know that after two decades of war the hour has come to at least try for peace above all friend and foe alike must never doubt this nation’s power and will to defend our people\\xa0eighteen years ago terrorists attacked the uss cole—and last month american forces killed one of the leaders of the attack we are honored to be joined tonight by tom wibberley whose son navy seaman craig wibberley was one of the  sailors we tragically lost tom we vow to always remember the heroes of the uss cole my administration has acted decisively to confront the world’s leading state sponsor of terror the radical regime in iran to ensure this corrupt dictatorship never acquires nuclear weapons i withdrew the united states from the disastrous iran nuclear deal\\xa0and last fall we put in place the toughest sanctions ever imposed on a country we will not avert our eyes from a regime that chants death to america and threatens genocide against the jewish people\\xa0we must never ignore the vile poison of antisemitism or those who spread its venomous creed\\xa0with one voice we must confront this hatred anywhere and everywhere it occurs just months ago  jewishamericans were viciously murdered in an antisemitic attack on the tree of life synagogue in pittsburgh\\xa0swat officer timothy matson raced into the gunfire and was shot seven times chasing down the killer\\xa0timothy has just had his  surgery—but he made the trip to\\xa0be here with us tonight\\xa0officer matson we are forever grateful for your courage in the face of evil tonight we are also joined by pittsburgh survivor judah samet\\xa0he arrived at the synagogue as the massacre began but not only did judah narrowly escape death last fall—more than seven decades ago he narrowly survived the nazi concentration camps today is judah’s  birthday\\xa0judah says he can still remember the exact moment nearly  years ago after  months in a concentration camp when he and his family were put on a train and told they were going to another camp\\xa0suddenly the train screeched to a halt\\xa0a soldier appeared\\xa0judah’s family braced for the worst\\xa0then his father cried out with joy \\xa0“it’s the americans” a second holocaust survivor who is here tonight joshua kaufman was a prisoner at dachau concentration camp he remembers watching through a hole in the wall of a cattle car as american soldiers rolled in with tanks\\xa0“to me” joshua recalls “the american soldiers were proof that god exists and they came down from the sky” i began this evening by honoring three soldiers who fought on dday in the second world war one of them was herman zeitchik\\xa0but there is more to herman’s story a year after he stormed the beaches of normandy herman was one of those american soldiers who helped liberate dachau\\xa0he was one of the americans who helped rescue joshua from that hell on\\xa0earth almost  years later herman and joshua are both together in the gallery tonight—seated sidebyside here in the home of american freedom\\xa0herman and joshua\\xa0your presence this evening honors and uplifts our entire nation when american soldiers set out beneath the dark skies over the english channel in the early hours of dday  they were just young men of  and  hurtling on fragile landing craft toward the most momentous battle in the history of war they did not know if they would survive the hour they did not know if they would grow old\\xa0but they knew that america had to prevail their cause was this nation and generations yet unborn why did they do it they did it for america—they did it for us everything that has come since—our triumph over communism our giant leaps of science and discovery our unrivaled progress toward equality and justice—all of it is possible thanks to the blood and tears and courage and vision of the americans who came before think of this capitol—think of this very chamber where lawmakers before you voted to end slavery to build the railroads and the highways to defeat fascism to secure civil rights to face down an evil empire here tonight we have legislators from across this magnificent republic\\xa0you have come from the rocky shores of maine and the volcanic peaks of hawaii from the snowy woods of wisconsin and the red deserts of arizona from the green farms of kentucky and the golden beaches of california together we represent the most extraordinary nation in all of history what will we do with this moment how will we be remembered i ask the men and women of this congress\\xa0look at the opportunities before us\\xa0our most thrilling achievements are still ahead\\xa0our most exciting journeys still await\\xa0our biggest victories are still to come we have not yet begun to\\xa0dream we must choose whether we are defined by our differences—or whether we dare to transcend them we must choose whether we will squander our inheritance—or whether we will proudly declare that we are americans we do the incredible\\xa0we defy the impossible\\xa0we conquer the unknown this is the time to reignite the american imagination\\xa0this is the time to search for the tallest summit\\xa0and set our sights on the brightest star this is the time to rekindle the bonds of love and loyalty and memory that link us together as citizens as neighbors as patriots this is our future—our fate—and our choice to make i\\xa0am asking you to choose greatness no matter the trials we face no matter the challenges to come we must go forward together we must keep america first in our hearts\\xa0we must keep freedom alive in our souls and we must always keep faith in america’s destiny—that one nation under god must be the hope and the promise and the light and the glory among all the nations of the world thank you god bless you god bless america and good night'"

       "'madam speaker mr vice president members of congress the\\xa0first lady of the united states and my fellow americans we meet tonight at a moment of unlimited potential\\xa0as we begin a new congress i stand here ready to work with you to achieve historic breakthroughs for all americans millions of our fellow citizens are watching us now gathered in this great chamber hoping that we will govern not as two parties but as one nation the agenda i will lay out this evening is not a republican agenda or a democrat agenda\\xa0it is the agenda of the american people many of us campaigned on the same core promises\\xa0to defend american jobs and demand fair trade for american workers to rebuild and revitalize our nations infrastructure to reduce the price of healthcare and prescription drugs to create an immigration system that is safe lawful modern and secure and to pursue a foreign policy that puts americas interests first there is a new opportunity in american politics if only we have the courage to seize it\\xa0victory is not winning for our party\\xa0victory is winning for our country this year america will recognize two important anniversaries that show us the majesty of americas mission and\\xa0the power of american pride in june we mark years since the start of what general dwight d eisenhower called the great crusade—the allied liberation of europe in world war ii\\xa0on dday june  young american men jumped from the sky and more stormed in from the sea to save our civilization from tyranny\\xa0here with us tonight are three of those heroes\\xa0private first class joseph reilly staff sergeant irving locker and sergeant herman zeitchik\\xa0gentlemen we salute you in we also celebrate years since brave young pilots flew a quarter of a million miles through space to plant the american flag on the face of the moon\\xa0half a century later we are joined by one of the apollo astronauts who planted that flag\\xa0buzz aldrin this year american astronauts will go back to space on american rockets in the century america saved freedom transformed science and redefined the middle class standard of living for the entire world to see\\xa0now we must step boldly and bravely into the next chapter of this great american adventure and we must create a new standard of living for the century\\xa0an amazing quality of life for all of our citizens is within our reach we can make our communities safer our families stronger our culture richer our faith deeper and our middle class bigger and more prosperous than ever before but we must reject the politics of revenge resistance and\\xa0retribution—and embrace the boundless potential of cooperation compromise and the common good together we can break decades of political stalemate\\xa0we can bridge old divisions heal old wounds build new coalitions forge new solutions and unlock the extraordinary promise of americas future\\xa0the decision is ours to make we must choose between greatness or gridlock results or resistance vision or vengeance incredible progress or pointless destruction tonight i ask you to choose greatness over the last years my administration has moved with urgency and historic speed to confront problems neglected by leaders of both parties over many decades in just over years since the election we have launched an unprecedented economic boom—a boom that has rarely been seen before\\xa0we have created million new jobs and importantly added new manufacturing jobs—something which almost everyone said was impossible to do but the fact is we are just getting started wages are rising at the fastest pace in decades and growing for blue collar workers who i promised to fight for faster than anyone else\\xa0nearly million americans have been lifted off food stamps\\xa0the united states economy is growing almost twice as fast today as when i took office and we are considered far and away the hottest economy anywhere in the world\\xa0unemployment has reached the lowest rate in half a century african american hispanic american and asian american unemployment have all reached their lowest levels ever recorded unemployment for americans with disabilities has also reached an alltime low\\xa0more people are working now than at any time in our history– million we passed a massive tax cut for working families and doubled the child tax credit we virtually ended the estate or death tax on small businesses ranches and family farms we eliminated the very unpopular obamacare individual mandate penalty—and to give critically ill patients access to lifesaving cures we passed right to try my administration has cut more regulations in a short time than any other administration during its entire tenure\\xa0companies are coming back to our country in large numbers thanks to historic reductions in taxes and regulations we have unleashed a revolution in american energy—the united states is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas in the world\\xa0and now for the first time in years we are a net exporter of energy after months of rapid progress our economy is the envy of the world our military is the most powerful on earth and america is winning each and every day\\xa0members of congress\\xa0the state of our union is strong\\xa0our country is vibrant and our economy is thriving like never before on friday it was announced that we added another jobs last month alone—almost double what was expected\\xa0an economic miracle is taking place in the united states—and the\\xa0only thing that can stop it are foolish wars politics or ridiculous partisan investigations if there is going to be peace and legislation there cannot be war and investigation it just doesnt work that way we must be united at home to defeat our adversaries abroad this new era of cooperation can start with finally confirming the more than highly qualified nominees who are still stuck in the senate some after years of waiting\\xa0the senate has failed to act on these nominations which is unfair to the nominees and to our country now is the time for bipartisan action\\xa0believe it or not we have already proven that it is possible in the last congress both parties came together to pass unprecedented legislation to confront the opioid crisis a sweeping new farm bill historic va reforms and after four decades of rejection we passed va accountability so we can finally terminate those who mistreat our wonderful veterans and just weeks ago both parties united for groundbreaking criminal justice reform\\xa0last year i heard through friends the story of alice johnson\\xa0i was deeply moved\\xa0in alice was sentenced to life in prison as a firsttime nonviolent drug offender\\xa0over the next two decades she became a prison minister inspiring others to choose a better path\\xa0she had a\\xa0big impact on that prison population—and far beyond alices story underscores the disparities and unfairness that can exist in criminal sentencing—and the need to remedy this injustice\\xa0she served almost years and had expected to be in prison for the rest of her life in june i commuted alices sentence and she is here with us tonight\\xa0alice thank you for reminding us that we always have the power to shape our own destiny when i saw alices beautiful family greet her at the prison gates hugging and kissing and crying and laughing i knew i did the right thing inspired by stories like alices my administration worked closely with members of both parties to sign the first step act into law\\xa0this legislation reformed sentencing laws that have wrongly and disproportionately harmed the african american community\\xa0the first step act gives nonviolent offenders the chance to reenter society as productive lawabiding citizens now states across the country are following our lead america is a nation that believes in redemption we are also joined tonight by matthew charles from tennessee\\xa0in at age matthew was sentenced to years for selling drugs and related offenses over the next two decades he completed more than bible studies became a law clerk and mentored fellow inmates now matthew is the very first person to be released from prison under the first step act\\xa0matthew on behalf of all americans welcome home as we have seen when we are united we can make astonishing strides for our country\\xa0now republicans and democrats must join forces again to confront an urgent national crisis the congress has days left to pass a bill that will fund our government protect our homeland and secure our southern border now is the time for the congress to show the world that america is committed to ending illegal immigration and putting the ruthless coyotes cartels drug dealers and human traffickers out of business as we speak large organized caravans are on the march to the united states\\xa0we have just heard that mexican cities in order to remove the illegal immigrants from their communities are getting trucks and buses to bring them up to our country in areas where there is little border protection\\xa0i have ordered another troops to our southern border to prepare for the tremendous onslaught this is a moral issue\\xa0the lawless state of our southern border is a threat to the safety security and financial well‑being of all americans\\xa0we have a moral duty to create an\\xa0immigration system that protects the lives and jobs of our citizens\\xa0this includes our obligation to the millions of immigrants living here today who followed the rules and respected our laws legal immigrants enrich our nation and strengthen our society in countless ways\\xa0i want people to come into our country but they have to come in legally tonight i am asking you to defend our very dangerous southern border out of love and devotion to our fellow citizens and to our country no issue better illustrates the divide between americas working class and americas political class than illegal immigration\\xa0wealthy politicians and donors push for open borders while living their lives behind walls and gates and guards meanwhile working class americans are left to pay the price for mass illegal migration—reduced jobs lower wages overburdened schools and hospitals increased crime and a\\xa0depleted social safety net tolerance for illegal immigration is not compassionate—it is cruel\\xa0one in three women is sexually assaulted on the long journey north smugglers use migrant children as human pawns to exploit our laws and gain access to our country human traffickers and sex traffickers take advantage of the wide open areas between our ports of entry to\\xa0smuggle thousands of young girls and women into the united\\xa0states and to sell them into prostitution and modernday slavery tens of thousands of innocent americans are killed by lethal drugs that cross our border and flood into our cities—including meth heroin cocaine and fentanyl the savage gang now operates in different american states and they almost all come through our southern border\\xa0just yesterday an gang member was taken into custody for a fatal shooting on a subway platform in new york city\\xa0we are removing these gang members by the thousands but until we secure our border theyre going to keep streaming back\\xa0in year after year countless americans are murdered by criminal illegal aliens ive gotten to know many wonderful angel moms dads and families—no one should ever have to suffer the horrible heartache they have endured here tonight is debra bissell\\xa0just three weeks ago debras parents gerald and sharon were burglarized and shot to\\xa0death in their reno nevada home by an illegal alien they\\xa0were in their eighties and are survived by four children \\xa0grandchildren and greatgrandchildren also here tonight are gerald and sharons granddaughter heather and great‑granddaughter madison to debra heather madison please stand few can understand your pain\\xa0but i will never forget and i will fight for the memory of gerald and sharon that it should never happen again not one more american life should be lost because our nation failed to control its very dangerous border in the last years our brave ice officers made arrests of criminal aliens including those charged or convicted of nearly assaults sex crimes and killings we are joined tonight by one of those law enforcement heroes\\xa0ice special agent elvin hernandez\\xa0when elvin was a boy he and his family legally immigrated to the united states from the dominican republic\\xa0at the age of eight elvin told his dad he wanted to become a special agent\\xa0today he leads investigations into the scourge of international sex trafficking\\xa0elvin says \\xa0if i can make sure these young girls get their justice ive done my job\\xa0thanks to his work and that of his colleagues more than women and girls have been rescued from horror and more than sadistic traffickers have been put behind bars in the last year special agent hernandez please stand\\xa0we will always support the brave men and women of law enforcement—and i pledge to you tonight that we will never abolish our heroes from ice my administration has sent to the congress a commonsense proposal to end the crisis on our southern border it includes humanitarian assistance more law enforcement drug detection at our ports closing loopholes that enable child smuggling and plans for a new physical barrier or wall to secure the vast areas between our ports of entry\\xa0in the past most of the people in this room voted for a wall—but the proper wall never got built ill get it built this is a smart strategic seethrough steel barrier—not just a simple concrete wall it will be deployed in the areas identified by border agents as having the greatest need and as these agents will tell you where walls go up illegal crossings go way down san diego used to have the most illegal border crossings in the country\\xa0in response and at the request of san diego residents and political leaders a strong security wall was put in place\\xa0this powerful barrier almost completely ended illegal crossings the border city of el paso texas used to have extremely high rates of violent crime—one of the highest in the country and considered one of our nations most dangerous cities\\xa0now with a powerful barrier in place el paso is one\\xa0of our safest cities simply put walls work and walls save lives\\xa0so lets work together compromise and reach a deal that will truly make america safe as we work to defend our peoples safety we must also ensure our economic resurgence continues at a rapid pace no one has benefitted more from our thriving economy than women who have filled percent of the new jobs created in the last year all americans can be proud that we have more women in the workforce than ever before—and exactly one century after the congress passed the constitutional amendment giving women the right to vote we also have more women serving in the congress than ever before as part of our commitment to improving opportunity for women everywhere this thursday we are launching the first ever governmentwide initiative focused on economic empowerment for women in developing countries to build on our incredible economic success one priority is paramount—reversing decades of calamitous trade policies we are now making it clear to china that after years of targeting our industries\\xa0and stealing our intellectual property the theft of\\xa0american jobs and wealth has come to an end therefore we recently imposed tariffs on billion of chinese goods—and now our treasury is receiving billions of dollars a month from a country that never gave us a\\xa0dime\\xa0but i\\xa0dont blame china for taking advantage of us—i\\xa0blame our leaders and representatives for allowing this travesty to happen\\xa0i have great respect for president xi and we are now working on a new trade deal with china\\xa0but it must include real structural change to end unfair trade practices reduce our chronic trade deficit and protect american jobs another historic trade blunder was the catastrophe known as nafta i have met the men and women of michigan ohio pennsylvania indiana new hampshire and many other states whose dreams were shattered by nafta\\xa0for years politicians promised them they would negotiate for a better deal but no one ever tried—until now our new usmexicocanada agreement—or usmca—will replace nafta and deliver for american workers\\xa0bringing back\\xa0our manufacturing jobs expanding american agriculture protecting intellectual property and ensuring that more cars are proudly stamped with four beautiful words\\xa0made in the usa tonight i am also asking you to pass the united states reciprocal trade act so that if another country places an unfair tariff on an american product we can charge them the exact same tariff on the same product that they sell to us both parties should be able to unite for a great rebuilding of americas crumbling infrastructure i know that the congress is eager to pass an infrastructure bill—and i am eager to work with you on legislation to deliver new and important infrastructure investment including investments in the cutting edge industries of the future\\xa0this is not an option\\xa0this is a necessity the next major priority for me and for all of us should be to lower the cost of healthcare and prescription drugs—and to protect patients with preexisting conditions already as a result of my administrations efforts in drug prices experienced their single largest decline in \\xa0years but we must do more\\xa0it is unacceptable that americans pay vastly more than people in other countries for the exact same drugs often made in the exact same place\\xa0this is wrong unfair and together we can stop it i am asking the congress to pass legislation that finally takes on the problem of global freeloading and delivers fairness and price transparency for american patients we should also require drug companies insurance companies and hospitals to disclose real prices to foster competition and bring costs down no force in history has done more to advance the human condition than american freedom\\xa0in recent years we have made remarkable progress in the fight against hiv and aids\\xa0scientific breakthroughs have brought a oncedistant dream within reach\\xa0my budget will ask democrats and republicans to make the needed commitment to eliminate the hiv epidemic in the united states within years\\xa0together we will defeat aids in\\xa0america tonight i am also asking you to join me in another fight that all americans can get behind\\xa0the fight against childhood cancer joining melania in the gallery this evening is a very brave girl grace eline every birthday since she was grace asked her friends to donate to st jude childrens research hospital\\xa0she did not know that one day she might be a\\xa0patient herself\\xa0last year grace was diagnosed with brain cancer\\xa0immediately she began radiation treatment\\xa0at the same time she rallied her community and raised more than for the fight against cancer when grace completed treatment last fall her doctors and nurses cheered with tears in their eyes as she hung up a poster that read\\xa0last day of chemo\\xa0grace—you are an inspiration to us all many childhood cancers have not seen new therapies in decades\\xa0my budget will ask the congress for million over the next years to fund this critical lifesaving research to help support working parents the time has come to pass school choice for americas children\\xa0i am also proud to be the first president to include in my budget a plan for nationwide paid family leave—so that every new parent has the chance to bond with their newborn child there could be no greater contrast to the beautiful image of a mother holding her infant child than the chilling displays our nation saw in recent days\\xa0lawmakers in new york cheered with delight upon the passage of legislation that would allow a\\xa0baby to be ripped from the mothers womb moments before birth\\xa0these are living feeling beautiful babies who will never get the chance to share their love and dreams with the world\\xa0and then we had the case of the governor of virginia where he basically stated he would execute a baby after birth to defend the dignity of every person i am asking the congress to pass legislation to prohibit the lateterm abortion of children who can feel pain in the mothers womb let us work together to build a culture that cherishes innocent life\\xa0and let us reaffirm a fundamental truth\\xa0all children—born and unborn— are made in the holy image of\\xa0god the final part of my agenda is to protect americas national security over the last years we have begun to fully rebuild the\\xa0united states military—with billion last year and billion this year\\xa0we are also getting other nations to pay their fair share\\xa0for years the united states was being treated very unfairly by nato—but now we have secured a \\xa0billion increase in defense spending from\\xa0nato allies as part of our military buildup the united states is developing a stateoftheart missile defense system under my administration we will never apologize for advancing americas interests for example decades ago the united states entered into a\\xa0treaty with russia in which we agreed to limit and reduce our missile capabilities\\xa0while we followed the agreement to the letter russia repeatedly violated its terms\\xa0that is why i\\xa0announced that the united states is officially withdrawing from the intermediaterange nuclear forces treaty or inf treaty perhaps we can negotiate a different agreement adding china and others or perhaps we cant–in which case we will outspend and outinnovate all others by far as part of a bold new diplomacy we continue our historic push for peace on the korean peninsula\\xa0our hostages have come home nuclear testing has stopped and there has not been a missile launch in months if i had not been elected president of the united states we would right now in my opinion be in a major war with north korea with potentially millions of people killed\\xa0much work remains to be done but my relationship with kim jong un is a good one\\xa0and chairman kim and i will meet again on february and in vietnam two weeks ago the united states officially recognized the legitimate government of venezuela and its new interim president juan guaido we stand with the venezuelan people in their noble quest for freedom—and we condemn the brutality of the maduro regime whose socialist policies have turned that nation from being the wealthiest in south america into a state of abject poverty and despair here in the united states we are alarmed by new calls to adopt socialism in our country\\xa0america was founded on liberty and independence–not government coercion domination and control\\xa0we are born free and we will stay free\\xa0tonight we\\xa0renew our resolve that america will never be a socialist country one of the most complex set of challenges we face is in the middle east our approach is based on principled realism—not discredited theories that have failed for decades to yield progress\\xa0for this reason my administration recognized the true capital of israel—and proudly opened the american embassy in jerusalem our brave troops have now been fighting in the middle east for almost years\\xa0in afghanistan and iraq nearly american heroes have given their lives\\xa0more than americans have been badly wounded\\xa0we have spent more than \\xa0trillion in the middle east as a candidate for president i pledged a new approach great nations do not fight endless wars when i took office isis controlled more than square miles in iraq and syria\\xa0today we have liberated virtually all of that territory from the grip of these bloodthirsty killers now as we work with our allies to destroy the remnants of isis it is time to give our brave warriors in syria a warm welcome home i have also accelerated our negotiations to reach a political settlement in afghanistan\\xa0our troops have fought with unmatched valor—and thanks to their bravery we are now able to pursue a political solution to this long and bloody conflict in afghanistan my administration is holding constructive talks with a number of afghan groups including the taliban\\xa0as we make progress in these negotiations we will be able to reduce our troop presence and focus on counterterrorism\\xa0we do not know whether we will achieve an agreement—but we do know that after two decades of war the hour has come to at least try for peace above all friend and foe alike must never doubt this nations power and will to defend our people\\xa0eighteen years ago terrorists attacked the uss cole—and last month american forces killed one of the leaders of the attack we are honored to be joined tonight by tom wibberley whose son navy seaman craig wibberley was one of the sailors we tragically lost tom we vow to always remember the heroes of the uss cole my administration has acted decisively to confront the worlds leading state sponsor of terror the radical regime in iran to ensure this corrupt dictatorship never acquires nuclear weapons i withdrew the united states

       "'mr president mr speaker members of the congress fellow citizens this last few months has not been an easy time for any of us as we meet tonight it has never been more clear that the state of our union depends on the state of the world and tonight as throughout our own generation freedom and peace in the world depend on the state of our union the have been born in turmoil strife and change this is a time of challenge to our interests and our values and its a time that tests our wisdom and our skills at this time in iran americans are still held captive innocent victims of terrorism and anarchy also at this moment massive soviet troops are attempting to subjugate the fiercely independent and deeply religious people of afghanistan these two acts one of international terrorism and one of military aggression present a serious challenge to the united states of america and indeed to all the nations of the world together we will meet these threats to peace im determined that the united states will remain the strongest of all nations but our power will never be used to initiate a threat to the security of any nation or to the rights of any human being we seek to be and to remain secure a nation at peace in a stable world but to be secure we must face the world as it is three basic developments have helped to shape our challenges the steady growth and increased projection of soviet military power beyond its own borders the overwhelming dependence of the western democracies on oil supplies from the middle east and the press of social and religious and economic and political change in the many nations of the developing world exemplified by the revolution in iran each of these factors is important in its own right each interacts with the others all must be faced together squarely and courageously we will face these challenges and we will meet them with the best that is in us and we will not fail in response to the abhorrent act in iran our nation has never been aroused and unified so greatly in peacetime our position is clear the united states will not yield to blackmail we continue to pursue these specific goals first to protect the present and longrange interests of the united states secondly to preserve the lives of the american hostages and to secure as quickly as possible their safe release if possible to avoid bloodshed which might further endanger the lives of our fellow citizens to enlist the help of other nations in condemning this act of violence which is shocking and violates the moral and the legal standards of a civilized world and also to convince and to persuade the iranian leaders that the real danger to their nation lies in the north in the soviet union and from the soviet troops now in afghanistan and that the unwarranted iranian quarrel with the united states hampers their response to this far greater danger to them if the american hostages are harmed a severe price will be paid we will never rest until every one of the american hostages are released but now we face a broader and more fundamental challenge in this region because of the recent military action of the soviet union now as during the last three and a half decades the relationship between our country the united states of america and the soviet union is the most critical factor in determining whether the world will live at peace or be engulfed in global conflict since the end of the second world war america has led other nations in meeting the challenge of mounting soviet power this has not been a simple or a static relationship between us there has been cooperation there has been competition and at times there has been confrontation in the we took the lead in creating the atlantic alliance in response to the soviet unions suppression and then consolidation of its east european empire and the resulting threat of the warsaw pact to western europe in the we helped to contain further soviet challenges in korea and in the middle east and we rearmed to assure the continuation of that containment in the we met the soviet challenges in berlin and we faced the cuban missile crisis and we sought to engage the soviet union in the important task of moving beyond the cold war and away from confrontation and in the three american presidents negotiated with the soviet leaders in attempts to halt the growth of the nuclear arms race we sought to establish rules of behavior that would reduce the risks of conflict and we searched for areas of cooperation that could make our relations reciprocal and productive not only for the sake of our two nations but for the security and peace of the entire world in all these actions we have maintained two commitments to be ready to meet any challenge by soviet military power and to develop ways to resolve disputes and to keep the peace preventing nuclear war is the foremost responsibility of the two superpowers thats why weve negotiated the strategic arms limitation treaties salt i and salt ii especially now in a time of great tension observing the mutual constraints imposed by the terms of these treaties will be in the best interest of both countries and will help to preserve world peace i will consult very closely with the congress on this matter as we strive to control nuclear weapons that effort to control nuclear weapons will not be abandoned we superpowers also have the responsibility to exercise restraint in the use of our great military force the integrity and the independence of weaker nations must not be threatened they must know that in our presence they are secure but now the soviet union has taken a radical and an aggressive new step its using its great military power against a relatively defenseless nation the implications of the soviet invasion of afghanistan could pose the most serious threat to the peace since the second world war the vast majority of nations on earth have condemned this latest soviet attempt to extend its colonial domination of others and have demanded the immediate withdrawal of soviet troops the moslem world is especially and justifiably outraged by this aggression against an islamic people no action of a world power has ever been so quickly and so overwhelmingly condemned but verbal condemnation is not enough the soviet union must pay a concrete price for their aggression while this invasion continues we and the other nations of the world cannot conduct business as usual with the soviet union thats why the united states has imposed stiff economic penalties on the soviet union i will not issue any permits for soviet ships to fish in the coastal waters of the united states ive cut soviet access to hightechnology equipment and to agricultural products ive limited other commerce with the soviet union and ive asked our allies and friends to join with us in restraining their own trade with the soviets and not to replace our own embargoed items and i have notified the olympic committee that with soviet invading forces in afghanistan neither the american people nor i will support sending an olympic team to moscow the soviet union is going to have to answer some basic questions will it help promote a more stable international environment in which its own legitimate peaceful concerns can be pursued or will it continue to expand its military power far beyond its genuine security needs and use that power for colonial conquest the soviet union must realize that its decision to use military force in afghanistan will be costly to every political and economic relationship it values the region which is now threatened by soviet troops in afghanistan is of great strategic importance it contains more than two thirds of the worlds exportable oil the soviet effort to dominate afghanistan has brought soviet military forces to within miles of the indian ocean and close to the straits of hormuz a waterway through which most of the worlds oil must flow the soviet union is now attempting to consolidate a strategic position therefore that poses a grave threat to the free movement of middle east oil this situation demands careful thought steady nerves and resolute action not only for this year but for many years to come it demands collective efforts to meet this new threat to security in the persian gulf and in southwest asia it demands the participation of all those who rely on oil from the middle east and who are concerned with global peace and stability and it demands consultation and close cooperation with countries in the area which might be threatened meeting this challenge will take national will diplomatic and political wisdom economic sacrifice and of course military capability we must call on the best that is in us to preserve the security of this crucial region let our position be absolutely clear an attempt by any outside force to gain control of the persian gulf region will be regarded as an assault on the vital interests of the united states of america and such an assault will be repelled by any means necessary including military force during the past three years you have joined with me to improve our own security and the prospects for peace not only in the vital oilproducing area of the persian gulf region but around the world weve increased annually our real commitment for defense and we will sustain this increase of effort throughout the fiveyear defense program its imperative that congress approve this strong defense budget for encompassing a percent real growth in authorizations without any reduction we are also improving our capability to deploy us military forces rapidly to distant areas weve helped to strengthen nato and our other alliances and recently we and other nato members have decided to develop and to deploy modernized intermediaterange nuclear forces to meet an unwarranted and increased threat from the nuclear weapons of the soviet union we are working with our allies to prevent conflict in the middle east the peace treaty between egypt and israel is a notable achievement which represents a strategic asset for america and which also enhances prospects for regional and world peace we are now engaged in further negotiations to provide full autonomy for the people of the west bank and gaza to resolve the palestinian issue in all its aspects and to preserve the peace and security of israel let no one doubt our commitment to the security of israel in a few days we will observe an historic event when israel makes another major withdrawal from the sinai and when ambassadors will be exchanged between israel and egypt weve also expanded our own sphere of friendship our deep commitment to human rights and to meeting human needs has improved our relationship with much of the third world our decision to normalize relations with the peoples republic of china will help to preserve peace and stability in asia and in the western pacific weve increased and strengthened our naval presence in the indian ocean and we are now making arrangements for key naval and air facilities to be used by our forces in the region of northeast africa and the persian gulf weve reconfirmed our agreement to help pakistan preserve its independence and its integrity the united states will take action consistent with our own laws to assist pakistan in resisting any outside aggression and im asking the congress specifically to reaffirm this agreement im also working along with the leaders of other nations to provide additional military and economic aid for pakistan that request will come to you in just a few days finally we are prepared to work with other countries in the region to share a cooperative security framework that respects differing values and political beliefs yet which enhances the independence security and prosperity of all all these efforts combined emphasize our dedication to defend and preserve the vital interests of the region and of the nation which we represent and those of our allies in europe and the pacific and also in the parts of the world which have such great strategic importance to us stretching especially through the middle east and southwest asia with your help i will pursue these efforts with vigor and with determination you and i will act as necessary to protect and to preserve our nations security the men and women of americas armed forces are on duty tonight in many parts of the world im proud of the job they are doing and i know you share that pride i believe that our volunteer forces are adequate for current defense needs and i hope that it will not become necessary to impose a draft however we must be prepared for that possibility for this reason i have determined that the selective service system must now be revitalized i will send legislation and budget proposals to the congress next month so that we can begin registration and then meet future mobilization needs rapidly if they arise we also need clear and quick passage of a new charter to define the legal authority and accountability of our intelligence agencies we will guarantee that abuses do not recur but we must tighten our controls on sensitive intelligence information and we need to remove unwarranted restraints on americas ability to collect intelligence the decade ahead will be a time of rapid change as nations everywhere seek to deal with new problems and ageold tensions but america need have no fear we can thrive in a world of change if we remain true to our values and actively engaged in promoting world peace we will continue to work as we have for peace in the middle east and southern africa we will continue to build our ties with developing nations respecting and helping to strengthen their national independence which they have struggled so hard to achieve and we will continue to support the growth of democracy and the protection of human rights in repressive regimes popular frustrations often have no outlet except through violence but when peoples and their governments can approach their problems together through open democratic methods the basis for stability and peace is far more solid and far more enduring that is why our support for human rights in other countries is in our own national interest as well as part of our own national character peace a peace that preserves freedom remains americas first goal in the coming years as a mighty nation we will continue to pursue peace but to be strong abroad we must be strong at home and in order to be strong we must continue to face up to the difficult issues that confront us as a nation today the crises in iran and afghanistan have dramatized a very important lesson our excessive dependence on foreign oil is a clear and present danger to our nations security the need has never been more urgent at long last we must have a clear comprehensive energy policy for the united states as you well know i have been working with the congress in a concentrated and persistent way over the past three years to meet this need we have made progress together but congress must act promptly now to complete final action on this vital energy legislation our nation will then have a major conservation effort important initiatives to develop solar power realistic pricing based on the true value of oil strong incentives for the production of coal and other fossil fuels in the united states and our nations most massive peacetime investment in the development of synthetic fuels the american people are making progress in energy conservation last year we reduced overall petroleum consumption by percent and gasoline consumption by percent below what it was the year before now we must do more after consultation with the governors we will set gasoline conservation goals for each of the states and i will make them mandatory if these goals are not met ive established an import ceiling for of million barrels a day well below the level of foreign oil purchases in i expect our imports to be much lower than this but the ceiling will be enforced by an oil import fee if necessary im prepared to lower these imports still further if the other oilconsuming countries will join us in a fair and mutual reduction if we have a serious shortage i will not hesitate to impose mandatory gasoline rationing immediately the single biggest factor in the inflation rate last year the increase in the inflation rate last year was from one cause the skyrocketing prices of opec oil we must take whatever actions are necessary to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and at the same time reduce inflation as individuals and as families few of us can produce energy by ourselves but all of us can conserve energy every one of us every day of our lives tonight i call on you in fact all the people of america to help our nation conserve energy eliminate waste make indeed a year of energy conservation of course we must take other actions to strengthen our nations economy first we will continue to reduce the deficit and then to balance the federal budget second as we continue to work with business to hold down prices well build also on the historic national accord with organized labor to restrain pay increases in a fair fight against inflation third we will continue our successful efforts to cut paperwork and to dismantle unnecessary government regulation fourth we will continue our progress in providing jobs for america concentrating on a major new program to provide training and work for our young people especially minority youth it has been said that a mind is a terrible thing to waste we will give our young people new hope for jobs and a better life in the and fifth we must use the decade of the to attack the basic structural weaknesses and problems in our economy through measures to increase productivity savings and investment with these energy and economic policies we will make america even stronger at home in this decade just as our foreign and defense policies will make us stronger and safer throughout the world we will never abandon our struggle for a just and a decent society here at home thats the heart of america and its the source of our ability to inspire other people to defend their own rights abroad our material resources great as they are are limited our problems are too complex for simple slogans or for quick solutions we cannot solve them without effort and sacrifice walter lippmann once reminded us you took the good things for granted now you must earn them again for every right that you cherish you have a duty which you must fulfill for every good which you wish to preserve you will have to sacrifice your comfort and your ease there is nothing for nothing any longer our challenges are formidable but theres a new spirit of unity and resolve in our country we move into the with confidence and hope and a bright vision of the america we want an america strong and free an america at peace an america with equal rights for all citizens  and for women guaranteed in the united states constitution an america with jobs and good health and good education for every citizen an america with a clean and bountiful life in our cities and on our farms an america that helps to feed the world an america secure in filling its own energy needs an america of justice tolerance and compassion for this vision to come true we must sacrifice but this national commitment will be an exciting enterprise that will unify our people together as one people let us work to build our strength at home and together as one indivisible union let us seek peace and security throughout the world together let us make of this time of challenge and danger a decade of national resolve and of brave achievement thank you very much  '"
