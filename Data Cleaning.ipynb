       "'Madam Speaker, Mr. Vice President, Members of Congress, the\\xa0First Lady of the United States, and my fellow Americans: We meet tonight at a moment of unlimited potential.\\xa0As we begin a new Congress, I stand here ready to work with you to achieve historic breakthroughs for all Americans. Millions of our fellow citizens are watching us now, gathered in this great chamber, hoping that we will govern not as two parties but as one Nation. The agenda I will lay out this evening is not a Republican agenda or a Democrat agenda.\\xa0It is the agenda of the American people. Many of us campaigned on the same core promises:\\xa0to defend American jobs and demand fair trade for American workers; to rebuild and revitalize our Nation’s infrastructure; to reduce the price of healthcare and prescription drugs; to create an immigration system that is safe, lawful, modern, and secure; and to pursue a foreign policy that puts America’s interests first. There is a new opportunity in American politics, if only we have the courage to seize it.\\xa0Victory is not winning for our party.\\xa0Victory is winning for our country. This year, America will recognize two important anniversaries that show us the majesty of America’s mission, and\\xa0the power of American pride. In June, we mark 75 years since the start of what General Dwight D. Eisenhower called the Great Crusade—the Allied liberation of Europe in World War II.\\xa0On D-Day, June 6, 1944, 15,000 young American men jumped from the sky, and 60,000 more stormed in from the sea, to save our civilization from tyranny.\\xa0Here with us tonight are three of those heroes:\\xa0Private First Class Joseph Reilly, Staff Sergeant Irving Locker, and Sergeant Herman Zeitchik.\\xa0Gentlemen, we salute you. In 2019, we also celebrate 50 years since brave young pilots flew a quarter of a million miles through space to plant the American flag on the face of the moon.\\xa0Half a century later, we are joined by one of the Apollo 11 astronauts who planted that flag:\\xa0Buzz Aldrin. This year, American astronauts will go back to space on American rockets. In the 20th century, America saved freedom, transformed science, and redefined the middle class standard of living for the entire world to see.\\xa0Now, we must step boldly and bravely into the next chapter of this great American adventure, and we must create a new standard of living for the 21st century.\\xa0An amazing quality of life for all of our citizens is within our reach. We can make our communities safer, our families stronger, our culture richer, our faith deeper, and our middle class bigger and more prosperous than ever before. But we must reject the politics of revenge, resistance, and\\xa0retribution—and embrace the boundless potential of cooperation, compromise, and the common good. Together, we can break decades of political stalemate.\\xa0We can bridge old divisions, heal old wounds, build new coalitions, forge new solutions, and unlock the extraordinary promise of America’s future.\\xa0The decision is ours to make. We must choose between greatness or gridlock, results or resistance, vision or vengeance, incredible progress or pointless destruction. Tonight, I ask you to choose greatness. Over the last 2 years, my administration has moved with urgency and historic speed to confront problems neglected by leaders of both parties over many decades. In just over 2 years since the election, we have launched an unprecedented economic boom—a boom that has rarely been seen before.\\xa0We have created 5.3 million new jobs and importantly added 600,000 new manufacturing jobs—something which almost everyone said was impossible to do, but the fact is, we are just getting started. Wages are rising at the fastest pace in decades, and growing for blue collar workers, who I promised to fight for, faster than anyone else.\\xa0Nearly 5 million Americans have been lifted off food stamps.\\xa0The United States economy is growing almost twice as fast today as when I took office, and we are considered far and away the hottest economy anywhere in the world.\\xa0Unemployment has reached the lowest rate in half a century. African American, Hispanic American, and Asian American unemployment have all reached their lowest levels ever recorded. Unemployment for Americans with disabilities has also reached an all-time low.\\xa0More people are working now than at any time in our history–-157 million. We passed a massive tax cut for working families and doubled the child tax credit. We virtually ended the estate, or death, tax on small businesses, ranches, and family farms. We eliminated the very unpopular Obamacare individual mandate penalty—and to give critically ill patients access to life-saving cures, we passed right to try. My administration has cut more regulations in a short time than any other administration during its entire tenure.\\xa0Companies are coming back to our country in large numbers thanks to historic reductions in taxes and regulations. We have unleashed a revolution in American energy—the United States is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas in the world.\\xa0And now, for the first time in 65 years, we are a net exporter of energy. After 24 months of rapid progress, our economy is the envy of the world, our military is the most powerful on earth, and America is winning each and every day.\\xa0Members of Congress:\\xa0the State of our Union is strong.\\xa0Our country is vibrant and our economy is thriving like never before. On Friday, it was announced that we added another 304,000 jobs last month alone—almost double what was expected.\\xa0An economic miracle is taking place in the United States—and the\\xa0only thing that can stop it are foolish wars, politics, or ridiculous partisan investigations. If there is going to be peace and legislation, there cannot be war and investigation. It just doesn’t work that way! We must be united at home to defeat our adversaries abroad. This new era of cooperation can start with finally confirming the more than 300 highly qualified nominees who are still stuck in the Senate, some after years of waiting.\\xa0The Senate has failed to act on these nominations, which is unfair to the nominees and to our country. Now is the time for bipartisan action.\\xa0Believe it or not, we have already proven that it is possible. In the last Congress, both parties came together to pass unprecedented legislation to confront the opioid crisis, a sweeping new Farm Bill, historic VA reforms, and after four decades of rejection, we passed VA Accountability so we can finally terminate those who mistreat our wonderful veterans. And just weeks ago, both parties united for groundbreaking criminal justice reform.\\xa0Last year, I heard through friends the story of Alice Johnson.\\xa0I was deeply moved.\\xa0In 1997, Alice was sentenced to life in prison as a first-time non-violent drug offender.\\xa0Over the next two decades, she became a prison minister, inspiring others to choose a better path.\\xa0She had a\\xa0big impact on that prison population—and far beyond. Alice’s story underscores the disparities and unfairness that can exist in criminal sentencing—and the need to remedy this injustice.\\xa0She served almost 22 years and had expected to be in prison for the rest of her life. In June, I commuted Alice’s sentence, and she is here with us tonight.\\xa0Alice, thank you for reminding us that we always have the power to shape our own destiny. When I saw Alice’s beautiful family greet her at the prison gates, hugging and kissing and crying and laughing, I knew I did the right thing. Inspired by stories like Alice’s, my administration worked closely with members of both parties to sign the First Step Act into law.\\xa0This legislation reformed sentencing laws that have wrongly and disproportionately harmed the African American community.\\xa0The First Step Act gives non-violent offenders the chance to re-enter society as productive, law-abiding citizens. Now, States across the country are following our lead. America is a Nation that believes in redemption. We are also joined tonight by Matthew Charles from Tennessee.\\xa0In 1996, at age 30, Matthew was sentenced to 35 years for selling drugs and related offenses. Over the next two decades, he completed more than 30 Bible studies, became a law clerk, and mentored fellow inmates. Now, Matthew is the very first person to be released from prison under the First Step Act.\\xa0Matthew, on behalf of all Americans: welcome home. As we have seen, when we are united, we can make astonishing strides for our country.\\xa0Now, Republicans and Democrats must join forces again to confront an urgent national crisis. The Congress has 10 days left to pass a bill that will fund our government, protect our homeland, and secure our southern border. Now is the time for the Congress to show the world that America is committed to ending illegal immigration and putting the ruthless coyotes, cartels, drug dealers, and human traffickers out of business. As we speak, large, organized caravans are on the march to the United States.\\xa0We have just heard that Mexican cities, in order to remove the illegal immigrants from their communities, are getting trucks and buses to bring them up to our country in areas where there is little border protection.\\xa0I have ordered another 3,750 troops to our southern border to prepare for the tremendous onslaught. This is a moral issue.\\xa0The lawless state of our southern border is a threat to the safety, security, and financial well‑being of all Americans.\\xa0We have a moral duty to create an\\xa0immigration system that protects the lives and jobs of our citizens.\\xa0This includes our obligation to the millions of immigrants living here today, who followed the rules and respected our laws. Legal immigrants enrich our Nation and strengthen our society in countless ways.\\xa0I want people to come into our country, but they have to come in legally. Tonight, I am asking you to defend our very dangerous southern border out of love and devotion to our fellow citizens and to our country. No issue better illustrates the divide between America’s working class and America’s political class than illegal immigration.\\xa0Wealthy politicians and donors push for open borders while living their lives behind walls and gates and guards. Meanwhile, working class Americans are left to pay the price for mass illegal migration—reduced jobs, lower wages, overburdened schools and hospitals, increased crime, and a\\xa0depleted social safety net. Tolerance for illegal immigration is not compassionate—it is cruel.\\xa0One in three women is sexually assaulted on the long journey north. Smugglers use migrant children as human pawns to exploit our laws and gain access to our country. Human traffickers and sex traffickers take advantage of the wide open areas between our ports of entry to\\xa0smuggle thousands of young girls and women into the United\\xa0States and to sell them into prostitution and modern-day slavery. Tens of thousands of innocent Americans are killed by lethal drugs that cross our border and flood into our cities—including meth, heroin, cocaine, and fentanyl. The savage gang, MS-13, now operates in 20 different American states, and they almost all come through our southern border.\\xa0Just yesterday, an MS-13 gang member was taken into custody for a fatal shooting on a subway platform in New York City.\\xa0We are removing these gang members by the thousands, but until we secure our border they’re going to keep streaming back\\xa0in. Year after year, countless Americans are murdered by criminal illegal aliens. I’ve gotten to know many wonderful Angel Moms, Dads, and families—no one should ever have to suffer the horrible heartache they have endured. Here tonight is Debra Bissell.\\xa0Just three weeks ago, Debra’s parents, Gerald and Sharon, were burglarized and shot to\\xa0death in their Reno, Nevada, home by an illegal alien. They\\xa0were in their eighties and are survived by four children, 11\\xa0grandchildren, and 20 great-grandchildren. Also here tonight are Gerald and Sharon’s granddaughter, Heather, and great‑granddaughter, Madison. To Debra, Heather, Madison, please stand: few can understand your pain.\\xa0But I will never forget, and I will fight for the memory of Gerald and Sharon, that it should never happen again. Not one more American life should be lost because our Nation failed to control its very dangerous border. In the last 2 years, our brave ICE officers made 266,000 arrests of criminal aliens, including those charged or convicted of nearly 100,000 assaults, 30,000 sex crimes, and 4,000 killings. We are joined tonight by one of those law enforcement heroes:\\xa0ICE Special Agent Elvin Hernandez.\\xa0When Elvin was a boy, he and his family legally immigrated to the United States from the Dominican Republic.\\xa0At the age of eight, Elvin told his dad he wanted to become a Special Agent.\\xa0Today, he leads investigations into the scourge of international sex trafficking.\\xa0Elvin says: \\xa0“If I can make sure these young girls get their justice, I’ve done my job.”\\xa0Thanks to his work and that of his colleagues, more than 300 women and girls have been rescued from horror, and more than 1,500 sadistic traffickers have been put behind bars in the last year. Special Agent Hernandez, please stand:\\xa0We will always support the brave men and women of Law Enforcement—and I pledge to you tonight that we will never abolish our heroes from ICE. My administration has sent to the Congress a commonsense proposal to end the crisis on our southern border. It includes humanitarian assistance, more law enforcement, drug detection at our ports, closing loopholes that enable child smuggling, and plans for a new physical barrier, or wall, to secure the vast areas between our ports of entry.\\xa0In the past, most of the people in this room voted for a wall—but the proper wall never got built. I’ll get it built. This is a smart, strategic, see-through steel barrier—not just a simple concrete wall. It will be deployed in the areas identified by border agents as having the greatest need, and as these agents will tell you, where walls go up, illegal crossings go way down. San Diego used to have the most illegal border crossings in the country.\\xa0In response, and at the request of San Diego residents and political leaders, a strong security wall was put in place.\\xa0This powerful barrier almost completely ended illegal crossings. The border city of El Paso, Texas, used to have extremely high rates of violent crime—one of the highest in the country, and considered one of our Nation’s most dangerous cities.\\xa0Now, with a powerful barrier in place, El Paso is one\\xa0of our safest cities. Simply put, walls work and walls save lives.\\xa0So let’s work together, compromise, and reach a deal that will truly make America safe. As we work to defend our people’s safety, we must also ensure our economic resurgence continues at a rapid pace. No one has benefitted more from our thriving economy than women, who have filled 58 percent of the new jobs created in the last year. All Americans can be proud that we have more women in the workforce than ever before—and exactly one century after the Congress passed the Constitutional amendment giving women the right to vote, we also have more women serving in the Congress than ever before. As part of our commitment to improving opportunity for women everywhere, this Thursday we are launching the first ever Government-wide initiative focused on economic empowerment for women in developing countries. To build on our incredible economic success, one priority is paramount—reversing decades of calamitous trade policies. We are now making it clear to China that after years of targeting our industries\\xa0and stealing our intellectual property, the theft of\\xa0American jobs and wealth has come to an end. Therefore, we recently imposed tariffs on $250 billion of Chinese goods—and now our Treasury is receiving billions of dollars a month from a country that never gave us a\\xa0dime.\\xa0But I\\xa0don’t blame China for taking advantage of us—I\\xa0blame our leaders and representatives for allowing this travesty to happen.\\xa0I have great respect for President Xi, and we are now working on a new trade deal with China.\\xa0But it must include real, structural change to end unfair trade practices, reduce our chronic trade deficit, and protect American jobs. Another historic trade blunder was the catastrophe known as NAFTA. I have met the men and women of Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Indiana, New Hampshire, and many other states whose dreams were shattered by NAFTA.\\xa0For years, politicians promised them they would negotiate for a better deal. But no one ever tried—until now. Our new U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement—or USMCA—will replace NAFTA and deliver for American workers:\\xa0bringing back\\xa0our manufacturing jobs, expanding American agriculture, protecting intellectual property, and ensuring that more cars are proudly stamped with four beautiful words:\\xa0made in the USA. Tonight, I am also asking you to pass the United States Reciprocal Trade Act, so that if another country places an unfair tariff on an American product, we can charge them the exact same tariff on the same product that they sell to us. Both parties should be able to unite for a great rebuilding of America’s crumbling infrastructure. I know that the Congress is eager to pass an infrastructure bill—and I am eager to work with you on legislation to deliver new and important infrastructure investment, including investments in the cutting edge industries of the future.\\xa0This is not an option.\\xa0This is a necessity. The next major priority for me, and for all of us, should be to lower the cost of healthcare and prescription drugs—and to protect patients with pre-existing conditions. Already, as a result of my administration’s efforts, in 2018 drug prices experienced their single largest decline in 46\\xa0years. But we must do more.\\xa0It is unacceptable that Americans pay vastly more than people in other countries for the exact same drugs, often made in the exact same place.\\xa0This is wrong, unfair, and together we can stop it. I am asking the Congress to pass legislation that finally takes on the problem of global freeloading and delivers fairness and price transparency for American patients. We should also require drug companies, insurance companies, and hospitals to disclose real prices to foster competition and bring costs down. No force in history has done more to advance the human condition than American freedom.\\xa0In recent years we have made remarkable progress in the fight against HIV and AIDS.\\xa0Scientific breakthroughs have brought a once-distant dream within reach.\\xa0My budget will ask Democrats and Republicans to make the needed commitment to eliminate the HIV epidemic in the United States within 10 years.\\xa0Together, we will defeat AIDS in\\xa0America. Tonight, I am also asking you to join me in another fight that all Americans can get behind:\\xa0the fight against childhood cancer. Joining Melania in the gallery this evening is a very brave 10-year-old girl, Grace Eline. Every birthday since she was 4, Grace asked her friends to donate to St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital.\\xa0She did not know that one day she might be a\\xa0patient herself.\\xa0Last year, Grace was diagnosed with brain cancer.\\xa0Immediately, she began radiation treatment.\\xa0At the same time, she rallied her community and raised more than $40,000 for the fight against cancer. When Grace completed treatment last fall, her doctors and nurses cheered with tears in their eyes as she hung up a poster that read:\\xa0“Last Day of Chemo.”\\xa0Grace—you are an inspiration to us all. Many childhood cancers have not seen new therapies in decades.\\xa0My budget will ask the Congress for $500 million over the next 10 years to fund this critical life-saving research. To help support working parents, the time has come to pass school choice for America’s children.\\xa0I am also proud to be the first President to include in my budget a plan for nationwide paid family leave—so that every new parent has the chance to bond with their newborn child. There could be no greater contrast to the beautiful image of a mother holding her infant child than the chilling displays our Nation saw in recent days.\\xa0Lawmakers in New York cheered with delight upon the passage of legislation that would allow a\\xa0baby to be ripped from the mother’s womb moments before birth.\\xa0These are living, feeling, beautiful babies who will never get the chance to share their love and dreams with the world.\\xa0And then, we had the case of the Governor of Virginia where he basically stated he would execute a baby after birth. To defend the dignity of every person, I am asking the Congress to pass legislation to prohibit the late-term abortion of children who can feel pain in the mother’s womb. Let us work together to build a culture that cherishes innocent life.\\xa0And let us reaffirm a fundamental truth:\\xa0all children—born and unborn— are made in the holy image of\\xa0God. The final part of my agenda is to protect America’s National Security. Over the last 2 years, we have begun to fully rebuild the\\xa0United States Military—with $700 billion last year and $716 billion this year.\\xa0We are also getting other nations to pay their fair share.\\xa0For years, the United States was being treated very unfairly by NATO—but now we have secured a $100\\xa0billion increase in defense spending from\\xa0NATO allies. As part of our military build-up, the United States is developing a state-of-the-art Missile Defense System. Under my administration, we will never apologize for advancing America’s interests. For example, decades ago the United States entered into a\\xa0treaty with Russia in which we agreed to limit and reduce our missile capabilities.\\xa0While we followed the agreement to the letter, Russia repeatedly violated its terms.\\xa0That is why I\\xa0announced that the United States is officially withdrawing from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, or INF Treaty. Perhaps we can negotiate a different agreement, adding China and others, or perhaps we can’t–-in which case, we will outspend and out-innovate all others by far. As part of a bold new diplomacy, we continue our historic push for peace on the Korean Peninsula.\\xa0Our hostages have come home, nuclear testing has stopped, and there has not been a missile launch in 15 months. If I had not been elected President of the United States, we would right now, in my opinion, be in a major war with North Korea with potentially millions of people killed.\\xa0Much work remains to be done, but my relationship with Kim Jong Un is a good one.\\xa0And Chairman Kim and I will meet again on February 27 and 28 in Vietnam. Two weeks ago, the United States officially recognized the legitimate government of Venezuela, and its new interim President, Juan Guaido. We stand with the Venezuelan people in their noble quest for freedom—and we condemn the brutality of the Maduro regime, whose socialist policies have turned that nation from being the wealthiest in South America into a state of abject poverty and despair. Here, in the United States, we are alarmed by new calls to adopt socialism in our country.\\xa0America was founded on liberty and independence–-not government coercion, domination, and control.\\xa0We are born free, and we will stay free.\\xa0Tonight, we\\xa0renew our resolve that America will never be a socialist country. One of the most complex set of challenges we face is in the Middle East. Our approach is based on principled realism—not discredited theories that have failed for decades to yield progress.\\xa0For this reason, my administration recognized the true capital of Israel—and proudly opened the American Embassy in Jerusalem. Our brave troops have now been fighting in the Middle East for almost 19 years.\\xa0In Afghanistan and Iraq, nearly 7,000 American heroes have given their lives.\\xa0More than 52,000 Americans have been badly wounded.\\xa0We have spent more than $7\\xa0trillion in the Middle East. As a candidate for President, I pledged a new approach. Great nations do not fight endless wars. When I took office, ISIS controlled more than 20,000 square miles in Iraq and Syria.\\xa0Today, we have liberated virtually all of that territory from the grip of these bloodthirsty killers. Now, as we work with our allies to destroy the remnants of ISIS, it is time to give our brave warriors in Syria a warm welcome home. I have also accelerated our negotiations to reach a political settlement in Afghanistan.\\xa0Our troops have fought with unmatched valor—and thanks to their bravery, we are now able to pursue a political solution to this long and bloody conflict. In Afghanistan, my administration is holding constructive talks with a number of Afghan groups, including the Taliban.\\xa0As we make progress in these negotiations, we will be able to reduce our troop presence and focus on counter-terrorism.\\xa0We do not know whether we will achieve an agreement—but we do know that after two decades of war, the hour has come to at least try for peace. Above all, friend and foe alike must never doubt this Nation’s power and will to defend our people.\\xa0Eighteen years ago, terrorists attacked the USS Cole—and last month American forces killed one of the leaders of the attack. We are honored to be joined tonight by Tom Wibberley, whose son, Navy Seaman Craig Wibberley, was one of the 17 sailors we tragically lost. Tom: we vow to always remember the heroes of the USS Cole. My administration has acted decisively to confront the world’s leading state sponsor of terror: the radical regime in Iran. To ensure this corrupt dictatorship never acquires nuclear weapons, I withdrew the United States from the disastrous Iran nuclear deal.\\xa0And last fall, we put in place the toughest sanctions ever imposed on a country. We will not avert our eyes from a regime that chants death to America and threatens genocide against the Jewish people.\\xa0We must never ignore the vile poison of anti-Semitism, or those who spread its venomous creed.\\xa0With one voice, we must confront this hatred anywhere and everywhere it occurs. Just months ago, 11 Jewish-Americans were viciously murdered in an anti-semitic attack on the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh.\\xa0SWAT Officer Timothy Matson raced into the gunfire and was shot seven times chasing down the killer.\\xa0Timothy has just had his 12th surgery—but he made the trip to\\xa0be here with us tonight.\\xa0Officer Matson: we are forever grateful for your courage in the face of evil. Tonight, we are also joined by Pittsburgh survivor Judah Samet.\\xa0He arrived at the synagogue as the massacre began. But not only did Judah narrowly escape death last fall—more than seven decades ago, he narrowly survived the Nazi concentration camps. Today is Judah’s 81st birthday.\\xa0Judah says he can still remember the exact moment, nearly 75 years ago, after 10 months in a concentration camp, when he and his family were put on a train, and told they were going to another camp.\\xa0Suddenly the train screeched to a halt.\\xa0A soldier appeared.\\xa0Judah’s family braced for the worst.\\xa0Then, his father cried out with joy: \\xa0“It’s the Americans.” A second Holocaust survivor who is here tonight, Joshua Kaufman, was a prisoner at Dachau Concentration Camp. He remembers watching through a hole in the wall of a cattle car as American soldiers rolled in with tanks.\\xa0“To me,” Joshua recalls, “the American soldiers were proof that God exists, and they came down from the sky.” I began this evening by honoring three soldiers who fought on D-Day in the Second World War. One of them was Herman Zeitchik.\\xa0But there is more to Herman’s story. A year after he stormed the beaches of Normandy, Herman was one of those American soldiers who helped liberate Dachau.\\xa0He was one of the Americans who helped rescue Joshua from that hell on\\xa0earth. Almost 75 years later, Herman and Joshua are both together in the gallery tonight—seated side-by-side, here in the home of American freedom.\\xa0Herman and Joshua:\\xa0your presence this evening honors and uplifts our entire Nation. When American soldiers set out beneath the dark skies over the English Channel in the early hours of D-Day, 1944, they were just young men of 18 and 19, hurtling on fragile landing craft toward the most momentous battle in the history of war. They did not know if they would survive the hour. They did not know if they would grow old.\\xa0But they knew that America had to prevail. Their cause was this Nation, and generations yet unborn. Why did they do it? They did it for America—they did it for us. Everything that has come since—our triumph over communism, our giant leaps of science and discovery, our unrivaled progress toward equality and justice—all of it is possible thanks to the blood and tears and courage and vision of the Americans who came before. Think of this Capitol—think of this very chamber, where lawmakers before you voted to end slavery, to build the railroads and the highways, to defeat fascism, to secure civil rights, to face down an evil empire. Here tonight, we have legislators from across this magnificent republic.\\xa0You have come from the rocky shores of Maine and the volcanic peaks of Hawaii; from the snowy woods of Wisconsin and the red deserts of Arizona; from the green farms of Kentucky and the golden beaches of California. Together, we represent the most extraordinary Nation in all of history. What will we do with this moment? How will we be remembered? I ask the men and women of this Congress:\\xa0Look at the opportunities before us!\\xa0Our most thrilling achievements are still ahead.\\xa0Our most exciting journeys still await.\\xa0Our biggest victories are still to come. We have not yet begun to\\xa0dream. We must choose whether we are defined by our differences—or whether we dare to transcend them. We must choose whether we will squander our inheritance—or whether we will proudly declare that we are Americans. We do the incredible.\\xa0We defy the impossible.\\xa0We conquer the unknown. This is the time to re-ignite the American imagination.\\xa0This is the time to search for the tallest summit\\xa0and set our sights on the brightest star. This is the time to rekindle the bonds of love and loyalty and memory that link us together as citizens, as neighbors, as patriots. This is our future—our fate—and our choice to make. I\\xa0am asking you to choose greatness. No matter the trials we face, no matter the challenges to come, we must go forward together. We must keep America first in our hearts.\\xa0We must keep freedom alive in our souls. And we must always keep faith in America’s destiny—that one Nation, under God, must be the hope and the promise and the light and the glory among all the nations of the world! Thank you. God Bless You, God Bless America, and good night!'"

       "'mr speaker mr vice president members of congress my fellow americans tonight marks the eighth year that i’ve come here to report on the state of the union\\xa0and for this final one i’m going to try to make it a little shorter applause i know some of you are antsy to get back to iowa laughter ive been there ill be shaking hands afterwards if you want some tips laughter and i understand that because it’s an election season expectations for what we will achieve this year are low\\xa0but mr speaker i appreciate the constructive approach that you and the other leaderstook at the end of last year to\\xa0pass a budget\\xa0and\\xa0make\\xa0tax cuts permanent\\xa0for working families so i hope we can work together this year on some bipartisan priorities like\\xa0criminal justice reform\\xa0 applause  and helping people who are battling prescription drug abuse and heroin abuse applause so who knows we might surprise the cynics again but tonight i want to go easy on the traditional list of proposals for the year ahead don’t worry i’ve got plenty from\\xa0helping students learn to write computer code\\xa0to\\xa0personalizing medical treatments for patients and i will keep pushing for progress on the work that i believe still needs to be done\\xa0fixing a broken immigration system applause\\xa0protecting our kids from gun violence applauseequal pay for equal work applause\\xa0paid leave applauseraising the minimum wage applause all these things still matter to hardworking families they’re still the right thing to do and i wont let up until they get done but for my final address to this chamber i don’t want to just talk about next year i want to focus on the next five years the next  years and beyond\\xa0i want to focus on our future we live in a time of extraordinary change  change that’s reshaping the way we live the way we work our planet our place in the world it’s change that promises amazing medical breakthroughs but also economic disruptions that strain working families it\\xa0promises education for girls in the most remote villages\\xa0but also connects terrorists plotting an ocean away it’s change that can broaden opportunity or widen inequality and whether we like it or not the pace of this change will only accelerate \\xa0america has been through big changes before  wars and depression the\\xa0influx of new immigrants workers fighting for a fair deal movements to expand civil rights\\xa0each time there have been those who told us to fear the future who claimed we could slam the brakes on change who promised to restore past glory if we just got some group or idea that was threatening america under control and each time we overcame those fears\\xa0we did not in the words of lincoln adhere to the “dogmas of the quiet past” instead we thought anew and acted anew\\xa0we made change work for us always extending america’s promise outward to the next frontier to more people and because we did  because we saw opportunity where others saw only peril  we emerged stronger and better than before what was true then can be true now our unique strengths as a nation  our optimism and work ethic our spirit of discovery our diversity our commitment to rule of law  these things give us everything we need to ensure prosperity and security for generations to come in fact it’s that spirit that made the progress of these past seven years possible\\xa0 it’s how we recovered from the worst economic crisis in generations\\xa0 it’s how we reformed our health care system and reinvented our energy sector how we delivered more care and benefits to our troops and veterans and\\xa0how we secured the freedom in every state to marry the person we love but such progress is not inevitable it’s the result of choices we make together and we face such choices right now will we respond to the changes of our time with fear turning inward as a nation turning against each other as a people or will we face the future with confidence in who we are in what we stand for in the incredible things that we can do together so let’s talk about the future and four big questions that i believe we as a country have to answer  regardless of who the next president is or who controls the next congress first how do we give everyone a fair shot at opportunity and security in this new economy\\xa0applause second how do we make technology work for us and not against us  especially when it comes to solving urgent challenges like climate change\\xa0applause third how do we keep america safe and lead the world without becoming its policeman\\xa0applause and finally how can we make our politics reflect what’s best in us and not what’s worst let me start with the economy and a basic fact\\xa0the united states of america right now\\xa0has the strongest most durable economy in the world\\xa0applause\\xa0we’re in the middle of the longest streak of private sector job creation in history\\xa0applause\\xa0more than  million new jobs the strongest two years of job growth since the ‘ an unemployment rate cut in half\\xa0our auto industry just had its best year ever applause thats just part of a manufacturing surge thats created nearly  new jobs in the past six yearsand we’ve done all this while cutting our deficits by almost threequarters\\xa0applause anyone claiming that america’s economy is in decline is peddling fiction applause now what is true  and the reason that a lot of americans feel anxious\\xa0 is that the economy has been changing in profound ways changes that started long\\xa0before the\\xa0great recession hit changes that have not let up today technology doesn’t just replace jobs on the assembly line but any job where work can be automated\\xa0companies in a global economy can locate anywhere and they face tougher competition as a result workers have less leverage for a raise\\xa0companies have less loyalty to their communities and more and more wealth and income is concentrated at the very top all these trends have squeezed workers even when they have jobs even when the economy is growing it’s made it harder for a hardworking family to pull itself out of poverty harder for young people to start their careers tougher for workers to retire when they want to and although none of these trends are unique to america they do offend our uniquely american belief that everybody who works hard should get a fair shot for the past seven years our goal has been a growing economy that works also better for everybody we’ve made progress but we need to make more and despite all the political arguments that we’ve had these past few years there are actually some areas where americans broadly agree we agree that real opportunity requires every american to get the education and training they need to land a goodpaying job\\xa0the bipartisan reform of no child left behind was an important start and together we’ve increased early childhood education\\xa0lifted high school graduation rates to new highs\\xa0boosted graduates in fields like engineering in the coming years we should build on that progress by providing prek for all and  applause  offering every student the handson computer science and math classes that make them jobready on day one we should recruit and support more great teachers for our kids applause and we have to make college affordable for every american applause no hardworking student should be\\xa0stuck in the redwe’ve already reduced student loan payments to  percent of a borrower’s income and thats good but now we’ve actually got to cut the cost of college\\xa0applause\\xa0providing two years of community college at no cost for every responsible student is one of the best ways to do that and i’m going to keep fighting to get that started this year applause its the right thing to do applause but a great education isn’t all we need in this new economy we also need benefits and protections that provide a basic measure of security it’s not too much of a stretch to say that some of the only people in america who are going to work the same job in the same place with a health and retirement package for  years are sitting in this chamber laughter for everyone else especially folks in their  and  saving for retirement or bouncing back from job loss has gotten a lot tougher americans understand that at some point in their careers in this new economy they may have to retool and they may have to retrain but they shouldn’t lose what they’ve already worked so hard to build in the process that’s why social security and medicare are more important than ever we shouldn’t weaken them we should strengthen themapplause and for americans short of retirement basic benefits should be just as mobile as everything else is today\\xa0that by the way is what the affordable care act is all about\\xa0it’s about filling the gaps in employerbased care so that when you lose a job or you go back to school or you strike out and launch that new business you’ll still have coverage nearly  million people have gained coverage so far applause and in the process health care inflation has slowedand our businesses have created jobs every single month since it became law now i’m guessing we won’t agree on health care anytime soon applause a little applause right there laughter just a guess but there should be other ways parties can work together to improve economic security say a hardworking american loses his job  we shouldn’t just make sure that he can get unemployment insurance we should make sure that program encourages him to retrain for a business that’s ready to hire him if that new job doesn’t pay as much there should be a system of wage insurance in place so that he can still pay his bills and even if he’s going from job to job he should still be able to save for retirement and take his savings with him that’s the way we make the new economy work better for everybody i also know speaker ryan has talked about his interest in tackling poverty america is about giving everybody willing to work a chance a hand up\\xa0and i’d welcome a serious discussion about strategies we can all support like expanding tax cuts for lowincome workers who dont have children\\xa0applause but there are some areas where we just have to be honest  it has been difficult to find agreement over the last seven years and a lot of them fall under the category of what role the government should play in making sure the system’s not rigged in favor of the wealthiest and biggest corporations applause and its an honest disagreement and the american people have a choice to make i believe a thriving private sector is the lifeblood of our economy i think there are outdated regulations that need to be changed there is red tape that needs to be cut applause there you go yes applause but after years now of record corporate profits working families won’t get more opportunity or bigger paychecks just by letting big banks or big oil or hedge funds make their own rules at everybody else’s expense applause middleclass families are not going to feel more secure because we allowed attacks on collective bargaining to go unanswered food stamp recipients did not cause the financial crisis recklessness on wall street did applause immigrants aren’t the principal reason wages haven’t gone up those decisions are made in the boardrooms that all too often put quarterly earnings over longterm returns it’s sure not the average family watching tonight that avoids paying taxes through offshore accounts applause the point is i believe that in this new economy workers and startups and small businesses need more of a voice not less the rules should work for them applause and im not alone in this this year i plan to lift up the many businesses who’ve figured out that doing right by their workers or their customers or their communities ends up being good for their shareholders applause and i want to spread those best practices across america thats part of a brighter future applause in fact it turns out many of our best corporate citizens are also our most creative and this brings me to the second big question we as a country have to answer how do we reignite that spirit of innovation to meet our biggest challenges sixty years ago when the russians beat us into space we didn’t deny sputnik was up there laughter we didn’t argue about the science or shrink our research and development budget\\xa0we built a space program almost overnight and  years later we were walking on the moon\\xa0applause now that spirit of discovery is in our dna america is thomas edison and the wright brothers\\xa0and george washington carver america is grace hopper and katherine johnson and sally ride america is every immigrant and entrepreneur from boston to austin to silicon valley racing to shape a better world applause thats who we are and over the past seven years we’ve nurtured that spirit\\xa0we’ve protected an open internet and taken bold new steps to get more students and lowincome americans online applause we’ve launched nextgeneration manufacturing hubs and online tools that give an entrepreneur everything he or she needs to start a business in a single day but we can do so much more last year vice president biden said that with a new moonshotamerica can cure cancer\\xa0last month he worked with this congress to give scientists at the national institutes of health the strongest resources that they’ve had in over a decade applause so tonight i’m announcing a new national effort to get it done and because he’s gone to the mat for all of us on so many issues over the past  years\\xa0i’m putting joe in charge of mission control applause\\xa0for the loved ones we’ve all lost for the families that we can still save let’s make america the country that cures cancer once and for allapplause medical research is critical we need the same level of commitment when it comes to developing clean energy sources applauselook if anybody still wants to dispute the science around climate change have at it you will be pretty lonely because you’ll be debating our military most of america’s business leaders the majority of the american people almost the entire scientific community and  nations around the world who agree it’s a problem and intend to solve it\\xa0applause but even if  even if the planet wasn’t at stake even if  wasn’t the warmest year on record  until  turned out to be even hotter  why would we want to pass up the chance for american businesses to produce and sell the energy of the future applause listen seven years ago we made the single biggest investment in clean energy in our history here are the results in fields from iowa to texas wind power is now cheaper than dirtier conventional power on rooftops from arizona to new york solar is saving americans tens of millions of dollars a year on their energy bills and employs more americans than coal  in jobs that pay better than average we’re taking steps to give homeowners the freedom to generate and store their own energy  something by the way that environmentalists and tea partiers have teamed up to support and meanwhile we’ve cut our imports of foreign oil by nearly  percent and cut carbon pollution more than any other country on earth applause gas under two bucks a gallon ain’t bad either\\xa0applause now we’ve got to accelerate the transition away from old dirtier energy sources rather than subsidize the past we should invest in the future  especially in communities that rely on fossil fuels we do them no favor when we dont show them where the trends are going that’s why i’m going to push to change the way we manage our oil and coal resources so that they better reflect the costs they impose on taxpayers and our planet and that way we put money back into those communities and put tens of thousands of americans to work building a  century transportation system applause now none of this is going to happen overnight and yes there are plenty of entrenched interests who want to protect the status quo but the jobs we’ll create the money we’ll save the planet we’ll preserve  that is the kind of future our kids and our grandkids deserve and its within our grasp climate change is just one of many issues where our security is linked to the rest of the world\\xa0and that’s why the third big question that we have to answer together is how to keep america safe and strong without either isolating ourselves or trying to nationbuild everywhere there’s a problem i told you earlier all the talk of america’s economic decline is political hot air well so is all the rhetoric you hear about our enemies getting stronger and america getting weaker let me tell you something the united states of america is the most powerful nation on earth period applause period it’s not even close its not even close applause its not even close we spend more on our military than the next eight nations combined our troops are the finest fighting force in the history of the world applause no nation attacks us directly or our allies because they know that’s the path to ruin\\xa0surveys show our standing around the world is higher than when i was elected to this office and when it comes to every important international issue people of the world do not look to beijing or moscow to lead  they call us\\xa0applause i mean its useful to level the set here because when we dont we dont make good decisions now as someone who begins every day with\\xa0an intelligence briefing i know this is a dangerous time but that’s not primarily because of some looming superpower out there and certainly not because of diminished american strength in today’s world we’re threatened less by evil empires and more by failing states the middle east is going through a transformation that will play out for a generation rooted in conflicts that date back millennia economic headwinds are blowing in from a chinese economy that is in significant transition even as their economy severely contracts russia is pouring resources in to prop up ukraine and syria  client states that they saw slipping away from their orbit\\xa0and the international system we built after world war ii is now struggling to keep pace with this new reality it’s up to us the united states of america to help remake that system\\xa0and to do that well it means that we’ve got to set priorities priority number one is protecting the american people and going after terrorist networks applause both al qaeda and now isil pose a direct threat to our people because in today’s world even a handful of terrorists who place no value on human life including their own can do a lot of damage they use the internet to poison the minds of individuals inside our country\\xa0their actions undermine and destabilize our allies\\xa0we have to take them outp but as we focus on destroying isil overthetop claims that this is world war iii just play into their hands masses of fighters on the back of pickup trucks twisted souls plotting in apartments or garages  they pose an enormous danger to civilians they have to be stopped but they do not threaten our national existence applause that is the story isil wants to tell that’s the kind of propaganda they use to recruit we don’t need to build them up to show that we’re serious and we sure dont need to push away vital allies in this fight by echoing the lie that isil is somehow representative of one of the world’s largest religions applause we just need to call them what they are  killers and fanatics who have to be rooted out hunted down and destroyed applause and that’s exactly what we’re doing\\xa0for more than a year america has led a coalition of more than  countries to cut off isil’s financing disrupt their plots\\xa0stop the flow of terrorist fighters and stamp out their vicious ideology with nearly  air strikes we’re taking out their leadership their oil their training camps their weapons\\xa0we’re training arming and supporting forces who are steadily reclaiming territory in iraq and syria if this congress is serious about winning this war and wants to send a message to our troops and the world authorize the use of military force against isil take a vote applause take a vote but the american people should know that with or without\\xa0congressional action isil will learn the same lessons as terrorists before them\\xa0if you doubt america’s commitment  or mine  to see that justice is done just ask osama bin laden\\xa0applause ask the leader of al qaeda in yemen who was taken out last year or the perpetrator of the benghazi attacks who sits in a prison cell when you come after americans we go after you applause and it may take time but we have long memories and our reach has no limits applause our foreign policy hast to be focused on the threat from isil and al qaeda but it can’t stop there for even without isil even without al qaeda instability will continue for decades in many parts of the world  in the middle east in afghanistan parts of pakistan in parts of central america in africa and asia some of these places may become safe havens for new terrorist networks others will just fall victim to ethnic conflict or famine feeding the next wave of refugees the world will look to us to help solve these problems and our answer needs to be more than tough talk or calls to carpetbomb civilians that may work as a tv sound bite but it doesn’t pass muster on the world stage we also can’t try to take over and rebuild every country that falls into crisis even if its done with the best of intentions applause that’s not leadership that’s a recipe for quagmire spilling american blood and treasure that ultimately will weaken us it’s the lesson of vietnam its the lesson of iraq  and we should have learned it by now applause fortunately there is a smarter approach a patient and disciplined strategy that uses every element of our national power it says america will always act alone if necessary to protect our people and our allies but on issues of global concern we will mobilize the world to work with us and make sure other countries pull their own weight that’s our approach to conflicts like syria where we’re partnering with local forces and leading international efforts to help that broken society pursue a lasting peace that’s why we built a global coalition with sanctions and principled diplomacy to prevent a nucleararmed iran and as we speak iran has rolled back its nuclear program shipped out its uranium stockpile and the world has avoided another war applause that’s how we stopped the spread of ebola in west africa applause our military our doctors our development workers  they were heroic they set up the platform that then allowed other countries to join in behind us and stamp out that epidemic hundreds of thousands maybe a couple million lives were saved that’s how we forged a transpacific partnership to open markets and protect workers and the environment and advance american leadership in asia it cuts  taxes on products made in america which will then support more good jobs here in america with tpp china does not set the rules in that region we do you want to show our strength in this new century approve this agreement give us the tools to enforce it its the right thing to do applause let me give you another example fifty years of isolating cuba had failed to promote democracy and set us back in latin america that’s why we\\xa0restored diplomatic relations\\xa0 applause  opened the door to travel and commerce positioned ourselves to improve the lives of the cuban people applause so if you want to consolidate our leadership and credibility in the hemisphere recognize that the cold war is over  lift the embargo applause the point is american leadership in the  century is not a choice between ignoring the rest of the world  except when we kill terrorists  or occupying and rebuilding whatever society is unraveling leadership means a wise application of military power and rallying the world behind causes that are right it means seeing our foreign assistance as a part of our national security not something separate not charity when we lead nearly  nations to the most ambitious agreement in history to fight climate change yes that helps vulnerable countries but it also protects our kids when we help ukraine defend its democracy or colombia resolve a decadeslong war that strengthens the international order we depend on when we help african countries feed their people and care for the sick  applause  its the right thing to do and it prevents the next pandemic from reaching our shores right now we’re on track to end the scourge of hivaids thats within our grasp applause and we have the chance to accomplish the same thing with malaria  something i’ll be pushing this congress to fund this year applause thats american strength thats american leadership and that kind of leadership depends on the power of our example\\xa0that’s why i will keep working to shut down the prison at guantanamo applause it is expensive it is unnecessary and it only serves as a recruitment brochure for our enemies applause there’s a better way applause and that’s why we need to reject any politics  any politics  that targets people because of race or religion applause let me just say this this is not a matter of political correctness this is a matter of understanding just what it is that makes us strong the world respects us not just for our arsenal it respects us for our diversity and our openness and the way we respect every faith his holiness pope francis told this body from the very spot that im standing on tonight that\\xa0“to imitate the hatred and violence of tyrants and murderers is the best way to take their place”\\xa0when politicians insult muslims whether abroad or our fellow citizens when a mosque is vandalized or a kid is called names that doesn’t make us safer that’s not telling it like it is it’s just wrong applause\\xa0it diminishes us in the eyes of the world it makes it harder to achieve our goals\\xa0it betrays who we are as a country applause “we the people” our constitution begins with those three simple words words we’ve come to recognize mean all the people not just some words that insist we rise and fall together and thats how we might perfect our union and that brings me to the fourth and maybe the most important thing that i want to say tonight the future we want  all of us want  opportunity and security for our families a rising standard of living a sustainable peaceful planet for our kids  all that is within our reach but it will only happen if we work together it will only happen if we can have rational constructive debates it will only happen if we fix our politics a better politics doesn’t mean we have to agree on everything this is a big country  different regions different attitudes different interests that’s one of our strengths too our founders distributed power between states and branches of government and expected us to argue just as they did fiercely over the size and shape of government over commerce and foreign relations over the meaning of liberty and the imperatives of security but democracy does require basic bonds of trust between its citizens it doesn’t work if we think the people who disagree with us are all motivated by malice it doesn’t work if we think that our political opponents are unpatriotic or trying to weaken america democracy grinds to a halt without a willingness to compromise or when even basic facts are contested or when we listen only to those who agree with us our public life withers when only the most extreme voices get all the attention and most of all democracy breaks down when the average person feels their voice doesn’t matter that the system is rigged in favor of the rich or the powerful or some special interest too many americans feel that way right now it’s one of the few regrets of my presidency  that the rancor and suspicion between the parties has gotten worse instead of better i have no doubt a president with the gifts of lincoln or roosevelt might have better bridged the divide and i guarantee i’ll keep trying to be better so long as i hold this office but my fellow americans this cannot be my task  or any president’s  alone there are a whole lot of folks in this chamber good people who would like to see more cooperation would like to see a more elevated debate in washington but feel trapped by the imperatives of getting elected by the noise coming out of your base i know you’ve told me its the worstkept secret in washington and a lot of you arent enjoying being trapped in that kind of rancor but that means if we want a better politics  and im addressing the american people now \\xa0if we want a better politics it’s not enough just to change a congressman or change a senator or even change a president we have to change the system to reflect our better selves\\xa0i think weve got to end the practice of drawing our congressional districts so that politicians can pick their voters and not the other way around applause let a bipartisan group do it applause we have to reduce the influence of money in our politics so that a handful of families or hidden interests can’t bankroll our elections applause and if our existing approach to campaign finance reform can’t pass muster in the courts we need to work together to find a real solution  because its a problem and most of you dont like raising money i know ive done it applause\\xa0we’ve got to make it easier to vote not harder applause we need to modernize it for the way we live now\\xa0applause this is america we want to make it easier for people to\\xa0participate and over the course of this year\\xa0i intend to travel the country to push for reforms that do just that but i can’t do these things on my own applause changes in our political process  in not just who gets elected but how they get elected  that will only happen when the american people demand it it depends on you that’s what’s meant by a government of by and for the people what i’m suggesting is hard it’s a lot easier to be cynical to accept that change is not possible and politics is hopeless and the problem is all the folks who are elected dont care and to believe that our voices and actions don’t matter but if we give up now then we forsake a better future those with money and power will gain greater control over the decisions that could send a young soldier to war or allow another economic disaster or roll back the equal rights and voting rights that generations of americans have fought even died to secure and then as frustration grows there will be voices urging us to fall back into our respective tribes to scapegoat fellow citizens who don’t look like us or pray like us or vote like we do or share the same background we can’t afford to go down that path it won’t deliver the economy we want it will not produce the security we want but most of all it contradicts everything that makes us the envy of the world so my fellow americans whatever you may believe whether you prefer one party or no party whether you supported my agenda or fought as hard as you could against it  our collective futures depends on your willingness to uphold your duties as a citizen to vote to speak out to stand up for others especially the weak especially the vulnerable knowing that each of us is only here because somebody somewhere stood up for us applause we need every american to stay active in our public life  and not just during election time  so that our public life reflects the goodness and the decency that i see in the american people every single day it is not easy our brand of democracy is hard but i can promise that a little over a year from now when i no longer hold this office i will be right there with you as a citizen inspired by those voices of fairness and vision of grit and good humor and kindness that helped america travel so far voices that help us see ourselves not first and foremost as black or white or asian or latino not as gay or straight immigrant or native born not as democrat or republican but as americans first bound by a common creed voices dr king believed would have the final word \\xa0voices of unarmed truth and unconditional love and they’re out there those voices they don’t get a lot of attention they dont seek a lot of fanfare but they’re busy doing the work this country needs doing i see them everywhere i travel in this incredible country of ours i see you the american people and in your daily acts of citizenship i see our future unfolding i\\xa0see it in the worker on the assembly line who clocked extra shifts to keep his company open and the boss who pays him higher wages instead of laying him off i see it in the dreamer who stays up late to finish her science project and the teacher who comes in early because he knows she might someday cure a disease i see it in the american who served his time and made mistakes as a child but now is dreaming of starting over  and i see it in the business owner who gives him that second chance the protester determined to prove that justice matters  and the young cop walking the beat treating everybody with respect doing the brave quiet work of keeping us safe applause i see it in the soldier who gives almost everything to save his brothers the nurse who tends to him till he can run a marathon the community that lines up to cheer him on it’s the son who finds the courage to come out as who he is and the father whose love for that son overrides everything he’s been taught\\xa0applause i see it in the elderly woman who will wait in line to cast her vote as long as she has to the new citizen who casts his vote for the first time the volunteers at the polls who believe every vote should count  because each of them in different ways know how much that precious right is worth thats the america i know that’s the country we love\\xa0cleareyed bighearted undaunted by challenge\\xa0optimistic that unarmed truth and unconditional love will have the final word applause that’s what makes me so hopeful about our future\\xa0i believe in change because i believe in you the american people and that’s why i stand here confident as i have ever been\\xa0that the state of our union is strong applause thank you god bless you god bless the united states of america'"

       "'mr speaker mr vice president members of congress my fellow americans tonight marks the eighth year that ive come here to report on the state of the union\\xa0and for this final one im going to try to make it a little shorter applause i know some of you are antsy to get back to iowa laughter ive been there ill be shaking hands afterwards if you want some tips laughter and i understand that because its an election season expectations for what we will achieve this year are low\\xa0but mr speaker i appreciate the constructive approach that you and the other leaderstook at the end of last year to\\xa0pass a budget\\xa0and\\xa0make\\xa0tax cuts permanent\\xa0for working families so i hope we can work together this year on some bipartisan priorities like\\xa0criminal justice reform\\xa0 applause  and helping people who are battling prescription drug abuse and heroin abuse applause so who knows we might surprise the cynics again but tonight i want to go easy on the traditional list of proposals for the year ahead dont worry ive got plenty from\\xa0helping students learn to write computer code\\xa0to\\xa0personalizing medical treatments for patients and i will keep pushing for progress on the work that i believe still needs to be done\\xa0fixing a broken immigration system applause\\xa0protecting our kids from gun violence applauseequal pay for equal work applause\\xa0paid leave applauseraising the minimum wage applause all these things still matter to hardworking families theyre still the right thing to do and i wont let up until they get done but for my final address to this chamber i dont want to just talk about next year i want to focus on the next five years the next  years and beyond\\xa0i want to focus on our future we live in a time of extraordinary change  change thats reshaping the way we live the way we work our planet our place in the world its change that promises amazing medical breakthroughs but also economic disruptions that strain working families it\\xa0promises education for girls in the most remote villages\\xa0but also connects terrorists plotting an ocean away its change that can broaden opportunity or widen inequality and whether we like it or not the pace of this change will only accelerate \\xa0america has been through big changes before  wars and depression the\\xa0influx of new immigrants workers fighting for a fair deal movements to expand civil rights\\xa0each time there have been those who told us to fear the future who claimed we could slam the brakes on change who promised to restore past glory if we just got some group or idea that was threatening america under control and each time we overcame those fears\\xa0we did not in the words of lincoln adhere to the dogmas of the quiet past instead we thought anew and acted anew\\xa0we made change work for us always extending americas promise outward to the next frontier to more people and because we did  because we saw opportunity where others saw only peril  we emerged stronger and better than before what was true then can be true now our unique strengths as a nation  our optimism and work ethic our spirit of discovery our diversity our commitment to rule of law  these things give us everything we need to ensure prosperity and security for generations to come in fact its that spirit that made the progress of these past seven years possible\\xa0 its how we recovered from the worst economic crisis in generations\\xa0 its how we reformed our health care system and reinvented our energy sector how we delivered more care and benefits to our troops and veterans and\\xa0how we secured the freedom in every state to marry the person we love but such progress is not inevitable its the result of choices we make together and we face such choices right now will we respond to the changes of our time with fear turning inward as a nation turning against each other as a people or will we face the future with confidence in who we are in what we stand for in the incredible things that we can do together so lets talk about the future and four big questions that i believe we as a country have to answer  regardless of who the next president is or who controls the next congress first how do we give everyone a fair shot at opportunity and security in this new economy\\xa0applause second how do we make technology work for us and not against us  especially when it comes to solving urgent challenges like climate change\\xa0applause third how do we keep america safe and lead the world without becoming its policeman\\xa0applause and finally how can we make our politics reflect whats best in us and not whats worst let me start with the economy and a basic fact\\xa0the united states of america right now\\xa0has the strongest most durable economy in the world\\xa0applause\\xa0were in the middle of the longest streak of private sector job creation in history\\xa0applause\\xa0more than  million new jobs the strongest two years of job growth since the  an unemployment rate cut in half\\xa0our auto industry just had its best year ever applause thats just part of a manufacturing surge thats created nearly  new jobs in the past six yearsand weve done all this while cutting our deficits by almost threequarters\\xa0applause anyone claiming that americas economy is in decline is peddling fiction applause now what is true  and the reason that a lot of americans feel anxious\\xa0 is that the economy has been changing in profound ways changes that started long\\xa0before the\\xa0great recession hit changes that have not let up today technology doesnt just replace jobs on the assembly line but any job where work can be automated\\xa0companies in a global economy can locate anywhere and they face tougher competition as a result workers have less leverage for a raise\\xa0companies have less loyalty to their communities and more and more wealth and income is concentrated at the very top all these trends have squeezed workers even when they have jobs even when the economy is growing its made it harder for a hardworking family to pull itself out of poverty harder for young people to start their careers tougher for workers to retire when they want to and although none of these trends are unique to america they do offend our uniquely american belief that everybody who works hard should get a fair shot for the past seven years our goal has been a growing economy that works also better for everybody weve made progress but we need to make more and despite all the political arguments that weve had these past few years there are actually some areas where americans broadly agree we agree that real opportunity requires every american to get the education and training they need to land a goodpaying job\\xa0the bipartisan reform of no child left behind was an important start and together weve increased early childhood education\\xa0lifted high school graduation rates to new highs\\xa0boosted graduates in fields like engineering in the coming years we should build on that progress by providing prek for all and  applause  offering every student the handson computer science and math classes that make them jobready on day one we should recruit and support more great teachers for our kids applause and we have to make college affordable for every american applause no hardworking student should be\\xa0stuck in the redweve already reduced student loan payments to  percent of a borrowers income and thats good but now weve actually got to cut the cost of college\\xa0applause\\xa0providing two years of community college at no cost for every responsible student is one of the best ways to do that and im going to keep fighting to get that started this year applause its the right thing to do applause but a great education isnt all we need in this new economy we also need benefits and protections that provide a basic measure of security its not too much of a stretch to say that some of the only people in america who are going to work the same job in the same place with a health and retirement package for  years are sitting in this chamber laughter for everyone else especially folks in their  and  saving for retirement or bouncing back from job loss has gotten a lot tougher americans understand that at some point in their careers in this new economy they may have to retool and they may have to retrain but they shouldnt lose what theyve already worked so hard to build in the process thats why social security and medicare are more important than ever we shouldnt weaken them we should strengthen themapplause and for americans short of retirement basic benefits should be just as mobile as everything else is today\\xa0that by the way is what the affordable care act is all about\\xa0its about filling the gaps in employerbased care so that when you lose a job or you go back to school or you strike out and launch that new business youll still have coverage nearly  million people have gained coverage so far applause and in the process health care inflation has slowedand our businesses have created jobs every single month since it became law now im guessing we wont agree on health care anytime soon applause a little applause right there laughter just a guess but there should be other ways parties can work together to improve economic security say a hardworking american loses his job  we shouldnt just make sure that he can get unemployment insurance we should make sure that program encourages him to retrain for a business thats ready to hire him if that new job doesnt pay as much there should be a system of wage insurance in place so that he can still pay his bills and even if hes going from job to job he should still be able to save for retirement and take his savings with him thats the way we make the new economy work better for everybody i also know speaker ryan has talked about his interest in tackling poverty america is about giving everybody willing to work a chance a hand up\\xa0and id welcome a serious discussion about strategies we can all support like expanding tax cuts for lowincome workers who dont have children\\xa0applause but there are some areas where we just have to be honest  it has been difficult to find agreement over the last seven years and a lot of them fall under the category of what role the government should play in making sure the systems not rigged in favor of the wealthiest and biggest corporations applause and its an honest disagreement and the american people have a choice to make i believe a thriving private sector is the lifeblood of our economy i think there are outdated regulations that need to be changed there is red tape that needs to be cut applause there you go yes applause but after years now of record corporate profits working families wont get more opportunity or bigger paychecks just by letting big banks or big oil or hedge funds make their own rules at everybody elses expense applause middleclass families are not going to feel more secure because we allowed attacks on collective bargaining to go unanswered food stamp recipients did not cause the financial crisis recklessness on wall street did applause immigrants arent the principal reason wages havent gone up those decisions are made in the boardrooms that all too often put quarterly earnings over longterm returns its sure not the average family watching tonight that avoids paying taxes through offshore accounts applause the point is i believe that in this new economy workers and startups and small businesses need more of a voice not less the rules should work for them applause and im not alone in this this year i plan to lift up the many businesses whove figured out that doing right by their workers or their customers or their communities ends up being good for their shareholders applause and i want to spread those best practices across america thats part of a brighter future applause in fact it turns out many of our best corporate citizens are also our most creative and this brings me to the second big question we as a country have to answer how do we reignite that spirit of innovation to meet our biggest challenges sixty years ago when the russians beat us into space we didnt deny sputnik was up there laughter we didnt argue about the science or shrink our research and development budget\\xa0we built a space program almost overnight and  years later we were walking on the moon\\xa0applause now that spirit of discovery is in our dna america is thomas edison and the wright brothers\\xa0and george washington carver america is grace hopper and katherine johnson and sally ride america is every immigrant and entrepreneur from boston to austin to silicon valley racing to shape a better world applause thats who we are and over the past seven years weve nurtured that spirit\\xa0weve protected an open internet and taken bold new steps to get more students and lowincome americans online applause weve launched nextgeneration manufacturing hubs and online tools that give an entrepreneur everything he or she needs to start a business in a single day but we can do so much more last year vice president biden said that with a new moonshotamerica can cure cancer\\xa0last month he worked with this congress to give scientists at the national institutes of health the strongest resources that theyve had in over a decade applause so tonight im announcing a new national effort to get it done and because hes gone to the mat for all of us on so many issues over the past  years\\xa0im putting joe in charge of mission control applause\\xa0for the loved ones weve all lost for the families that we can still save lets make america the country that cures cancer once and for allapplause medical research is critical we need the same level of commitment when it comes to developing clean energy sources applauselook if anybody still wants to dispute the science around climate change have at it you will be pretty lonely because youll be debating our military most of americas business leaders the majority of the american people almost the entire scientific community and  nations around the world who agree its a problem and intend to solve it\\xa0applause but even if  even if the planet wasnt at stake even if  wasnt the warmest year on record  until  turned out to be even hotter  why would we want to pass up the chance for american businesses to produce and sell the energy of the future applause listen seven years ago we made the single biggest investment in clean energy in our history here are the results in fields from iowa to texas wind power is now cheaper than dirtier conventional power on rooftops from arizona to new york solar is saving americans tens of millions of dollars a year on their energy bills and employs more americans than coal  in jobs that pay better than average were taking steps to give homeowners the freedom to generate and store their own energy  something by the way that environmentalists and tea partiers have teamed up to support and meanwhile weve cut our imports of foreign oil by nearly  percent and cut carbon pollution more than any other country on earth applause gas under two bucks a gallon aint bad either\\xa0applause now weve got to accelerate the transition away from old dirtier energy sources rather than subsidize the past we should invest in the future  especially in communities that rely on fossil fuels we do them no favor when we dont show them where the trends are going thats why im going to push to change the way we manage our oil and coal resources so that they better reflect the costs they impose on taxpayers and our planet and that way we put money back into those communities and put tens of thousands of americans to work building a  century transportation system applause now none of this is going to happen overnight and yes there are plenty of entrenched interests who want to protect the status quo but the jobs well create the money well save the planet well preserve  that is the kind of future our kids and our grandkids deserve and its within our grasp climate change is just one of many issues where our security is linked to the rest of the world\\xa0and thats why the third big question that we have to answer together is how to keep america safe and strong without either isolating ourselves or trying to nationbuild everywhere theres a problem i told you earlier all the talk of americas economic decline is political hot air well so is all the rhetoric you hear about our enemies getting stronger and america getting weaker let me tell you something the united states of america is the most powerful nation on earth period applause period its not even close its not even close applause its not even close we spend more on our military than the next eight nations combined our troops are the finest fighting force in the history of the world applause no nation attacks us directly or our allies because they know thats the path to ruin\\xa0surveys show our standing around the world is higher than when i was elected to this office and when it comes to every important international issue people of the world do not look to beijing or moscow to lead  they call us\\xa0applause i mean its useful to level the set here because when we dont we dont make good decisions now as someone who begins every day with\\xa0an intelligence briefing i know this is a dangerous time but thats not primarily because of some looming superpower out there and certainly not because of diminished american strength in todays world were threatened less by evil empires and more by failing states the middle east is going through a transformation that will play out for a generation rooted in conflicts that date back millennia economic headwinds are blowing in from a chinese economy that is in significant transition even as their economy severely contracts russia is pouring resources in to prop up ukraine and syria  client states that they saw slipping away from their orbit\\xa0and the international system we built after world war ii is now struggling to keep pace with this new reality its up to us the united states of america to help remake that system\\xa0and to do that well it means that weve got to set priorities priority number one is protecting the american people and going after terrorist networks applause both al qaeda and now isil pose a direct threat to our people because in todays world even a handful of terrorists who place no value on human life including their own can do a lot of damage they use the internet to poison the minds of individuals inside our country\\xa0their actions undermine and destabilize our allies\\xa0we have to take them outp but as we focus on destroying isil overthetop claims that this is world war iii just play into their hands masses of fighters on the back of pickup trucks twisted souls plotting in apartments or garages  they pose an enormous danger to civilians they have to be stopped but they do not threaten our national existence applause that is the story isil wants to tell thats the kind of propaganda they use to recruit we dont need to build them up to show that were serious and we sure dont need to push away vital allies in this fight by echoing the lie that isil is somehow representative of one of the worlds largest religions applause we just need to call them what they are  killers and fanatics who have to be rooted out hunted down and destroyed applause and thats exactly what were doing\\xa0for more than a year america has led a coalition of more than  countries to cut off isils financing disrupt their plots\\xa0stop the flow of terrorist fighters and stamp out their vicious ideology with nearly  air strikes were taking out their leadership their oil their training camps their weapons\\xa0were training arming and supporting forces who are steadily reclaiming territory in iraq and syria if this congress is serious about winning this war and wants to send a message to our troops and the world authorize the use of military force against isil take a vote applause take a vote but the american people should know that with or without\\xa0congressional action isil will learn the same lessons as terrorists before them\\xa0if you doubt americas commitment  or mine  to see that justice is done just ask osama bin laden\\xa0applause ask the leader of al qaeda in yemen who was taken out last year or the perpetrator of the benghazi attacks who sits in a prison cell when you come after americans we go after you applause and it may take time but we have long memories and our reach has no limits applause our foreign policy hast to be focused on the threat from isil and al qaeda but it cant stop there for even without isil even without al qaeda instability will continue for decades in many parts of the world  in the middle east in afghanistan parts of pakistan in parts of central america in africa and asia some of these places may become safe havens for new terrorist networks others will just fall victim to ethnic conflict or famine feeding the next wave of refugees the world will look to us to help solve these problems and our answer needs to be more than tough talk or calls to carpetbomb civilians that may work as a tv sound bite but it doesnt pass muster on the world stage we also cant try to take over and rebuild every country that falls into crisis even if its done with the best of intentions applause thats not leadership thats a recipe for quagmire spilling american blood and treasure that ultimately will weaken us its the lesson of vietnam its the lesson of iraq  and we should have learned it by now applause fortunately there is a smarter approach a patient and disciplined strategy that uses every element of our national power it says america will always act alone if necessary to protect our people and our allies but on issues of global concern we will mobilize the world to work with us and make sure other countries pull their own weight thats our approach to conflicts like syria where were partnering with local forces and leading international efforts to help that broken society pursue a lasting peace thats why we built a global coalition with sanctions and principled diplomacy to prevent a nucleararmed iran and as we speak iran has rolled back its nuclear program shipped out its uranium stockpile and the world has avoided another war applause thats how we stopped the spread of ebola in west africa applause our military our doctors our development workers  they were heroic they set up the platform that then allowed other countries to join in behind us and stamp out that epidemic hundreds of thousands maybe a couple million lives were saved thats how we forged a transpacific partnership to open markets and protect workers and the environment and advance american leadership in asia it cuts  taxes on products made in america which will then support more good jobs here in america with tpp china does not set the rules in that region we do you want to show our strength in this new century approve this agreement give us the tools to enforce it its the right thing to do applause let me give you another example fifty years of isolating cuba had failed to promote democracy and set us back in latin america thats why we\\xa0restored diplomatic relations\\xa0 applause  opened the door to travel and commerce positioned ourselves to improve the lives of the cuban people applause so if you want to consolidate our leadership and credibility in the hemisphere recognize that the cold war is over  lift the embargo applause the point is american leadership in the  century is not a choice between ignoring the rest of the world  except when we kill terrorists  or occupying and rebuilding whatever society is unraveling leadership means a wise application of military power and rallying the world behind causes that are right it means seeing our foreign assistance as a part of our national security not something separate not charity when we lead nearly  nations to the most ambitious agreement in history to fight climate change yes that helps vulnerable countries but it also protects our kids when we help ukraine defend its democracy or colombia resolve a decadeslong war that strengthens the international order we depend on when we help african countries feed their people and care for the sick  applause  its the right thing to do and it prevents the next pandemic from reaching our shores right now were on track to end the scourge of hivaids thats within our grasp applause and we have the chance to accomplish the same thing with malaria  something ill be pushing this congress to fund this year applause thats american strength thats american leadership and that kind of leadership depends on the power of our example\\xa0thats why i will keep working to shut down the prison at guantanamo applause it is expensive it is unnecessary and it only serves as a recruitment brochure for our enemies applause theres a better way applause and thats why we need to reject any politics  any politics  that targets people because of race or religion applause let me just say this this is not a matter of political correctness this is a matter of understanding just what it is that makes us strong the world respects us not just for our arsenal it respects us for our diversity and our openness and the way we respect every faith his holiness pope francis told this body from the very spot that im standing on tonight that\\xa0to imitate the hatred and violence of tyrants and murderers is the best way to take their place\\xa0when politicians insult muslims whether abroad or our fellow citizens when a mosque is vandalized or a kid is called names that doesnt make us safer thats not telling it like it is its just wrong applause\\xa0it diminishes us in the eyes of the world it makes it harder to achieve our goals\\xa0it betrays who we are as a country applause we the people our constitution begins with those three simple words words weve come to recognize mean all the people not just some words that insist we rise and fall together and thats how we might perfect our union and that brings me to the fourth and maybe the most important thing that i want to say tonight the future we want  all of us want  opportunity and security for our families a rising standard of living a sustainable peaceful planet for our kids  all that is within our reach but it will only happen if we work together it will only happen if we can have rational constructive debates it will only happen if we fix our politics a better politics doesnt mean we have to agree on everything this is a big country  different regions different attitudes different interests thats one of our strengths too our founders distributed power between states and branches of government and expected us to argue just as they did fiercely over the size and shape of government over commerce and foreign relations over the meaning of liberty and the imperatives of security but democracy does require basic bonds of trust between its citizens it doesnt work if we think the people who disagree with us are all motivated by malice it doesnt work if we think that our political opponents are unpatriotic or trying to weaken america democracy grinds to a halt without a willingness to compromise or when even basic facts are contested or when we listen only to those who agree with us our public life withers when only the most extreme voices get all the attention and most of all democracy breaks down when the average person feels their voice doesnt matter that the system is rigged in favor of the rich or the powerful or some special interest too many americans feel that way right now its one of the few regrets of my presidency  that the rancor and suspicion between the parties has gotten worse instead of better i have no doubt a president with the gifts of lincoln or roosevelt might have better bridged the divide and i guarantee ill keep trying to be better so long as i hold this office but my fellow americans this cannot be my task  or any presidents  alone there are a whole lot of folks in this chamber good people who would like to see more cooperation would like to see a more elevated debate in washington but feel trapped by the imperatives of getting elected by the noise coming out of your base i know youve told me its the worstkept secret in washington and a lot of you arent enjoying being trapped in that kind of rancor but that means if we want a better politics  and im addressing the american people now \\xa0if we want a better politics its not enough just to change a congressman or change a senator or even change a president we have to change the system to reflect our better selves\\xa0i think weve got to end the practice of drawing our congressional districts so that politicians can pick their voters and not the other way around applause let a bipartisan group do it applause we have to reduce the influence of money in our politics so that a handful of families or hidden interests cant bankroll our elections applause and if our existing approach to campaign finance reform cant pass muster in the courts we need to work together to find a real solution  because its a problem and most of you dont like raising money i know ive done it applause\\xa0weve got to make it easier to vote not harder applause we need to modernize it for the way we live now\\xa0applause this is america we want to make it easier for people to\\xa0participate and over the course of this year\\xa0i intend to travel the country to push for reforms that do just that but i cant do these things on my own applause changes in our political process  in not just who gets elected but how they get elected  that will only happen when the american people demand it it depends on you thats whats meant by a government of by and for the people what im suggesting is hard its a lot easier to be cynical to accept that change is not possible and politics is hopeless and the problem is all the folks who are elected dont care and to believe that our voices and actions dont matter but if we give up now then we forsake a better future those with money and power will gain greater control over the decisions that could send a young soldier to war or allow another economic disaster or roll back the equal rights and voting rights that generations of americans have fought even died to secure and then as frustration grows there will be voices urging us to fall back into our respective tribes to scapegoat fellow citizens who dont look like us or pray like us or vote like we do or share the same background we cant afford to go down that path it wont deliver the economy we want it will not produce the security we want but most of all it contradicts everything that makes us the envy of the world so my fellow americans whatever you may believe whether you prefer one party or no party whether you supported my agenda or fought as hard as you could against it  our collective futures depends on your willingness to uphold your duties as a citizen to vote to speak out to stand up for others especially the weak especially the vulnerable knowing that each of us is only here because somebody somewhere stood up for us applause we need every american to stay active in our public life  and not just during election time  so that our public life reflects the goodness and the decency that i see in the american people every single day it is not easy our brand of democracy is hard but i can promise that a little over a year from now when i no longer hold this office i will be right there with you as a citizen inspired by those voices of fairness and vision of grit and good humor and kindness that helped america travel so far voices that help us see ourselves not first and foremost as black or white or asian or latino not as gay or straight immigrant or native born not as democrat or republican but as americans first bound by a common creed voices dr king believed would have the final word \\xa0voices of unarmed truth and unconditional love and theyre out there those voices they dont get a lot of attention they dont seek a lot of fanfare but theyre busy doing the work this country needs doing i see them everywhere i travel in this incredible country of ours i see you the american people and in your daily acts of citizenship i see our future unfolding i\\xa0see it in the worker on the assembly line who clocked extra shifts to keep his company open and the boss who pays him higher wages instead of laying him off i see it in the dreamer who stays up late to finish her science project and the teacher who comes in early because he knows she might someday cure a disease i see it in the american who served his time and made mistakes as a child but now is dreaming of starting over  and i see it in the business owner who gives him that second chance the protester determined to prove that justice matters  and the young cop walking the beat treating everybody with respect doing the brave quiet work of keeping us safe applause i see it in the soldier who gives almost everything to save his brothers the nurse who tends to him till he can run a marathon the community that lines up to cheer him on its the son who finds the courage to come out as who he is and the father whose love for that son overrides everything hes been taught\\xa0applause i see it in the elderly woman who will wait in line to cast her vote as long as she has to the new citizen who casts his vote for the first time the volunteers at the polls who believe every vote should count  because each of them in different ways know how much that precious right is worth thats the america i know thats the country we love\\xa0cleareyed bighearted undaunted by challenge\\xa0optimistic that unarmed truth and unconditional love will have the final word applause thats what makes me so hopeful about our future\\xa0i believe in change because i believe in you the american people and thats why i stand here confident as i have ever been\\xa0that the state of our union is strong applause thank you god bless you god bless the united states of america'"

       "'mr speaker mr vice president members of congress my fellow americans tonight marks the eighth year that ive come here to report on the state of the union and for this final one im going to try to make it a little shorter applause i know some of you are antsy to get back to iowa laughter ive been there ill be shaking hands afterwards if you want some tips laughter and i understand that because its an election season expectations for what we will achieve this year are low but mr speaker i appreciate the constructive approach that you and the other leaderstook at the end of last year to pass a budget and make tax cuts permanent for working families so i hope we can work together this year on some bipartisan priorities like criminal justice reform  applause  and helping people who are battling prescription drug abuse and heroin abuse applause so who knows we might surprise the cynics again but tonight i want to go easy on the traditional list of proposals for the year ahead dont worry ive got plenty from helping students learn to write computer code to personalizing medical treatments for patients and i will keep pushing for progress on the work that i believe still needs to be done fixing a broken immigration system applause protecting our kids from gun violence applauseequal pay for equal work applause paid leave applauseraising the minimum wage applause all these things still matter to hardworking families theyre still the right thing to do and i wont let up until they get done but for my final address to this chamber i dont want to just talk about next year i want to focus on the next five years the next  years and beyond i want to focus on our future we live in a time of extraordinary change  change thats reshaping the way we live the way we work our planet our place in the world its change that promises amazing medical breakthroughs but also economic disruptions that strain working families it promises education for girls in the most remote villages but also connects terrorists plotting an ocean away its change that can broaden opportunity or widen inequality and whether we like it or not the pace of this change will only accelerate  america has been through big changes before  wars and depression the influx of new immigrants workers fighting for a fair deal movements to expand civil rights each time there have been those who told us to fear the future who claimed we could slam the brakes on change who promised to restore past glory if we just got some group or idea that was threatening america under control and each time we overcame those fears we did not in the words of lincoln adhere to the dogmas of the quiet past instead we thought anew and acted anew we made change work for us always extending americas promise outward to the next frontier to more people and because we did  because we saw opportunity where others saw only peril  we emerged stronger and better than before what was true then can be true now our unique strengths as a nation  our optimism and work ethic our spirit of discovery our diversity our commitment to rule of law  these things give us everything we need to ensure prosperity and security for generations to come in fact its that spirit that made the progress of these past seven years possible  its how we recovered from the worst economic crisis in generations  its how we reformed our health care system and reinvented our energy sector how we delivered more care and benefits to our troops and veterans and how we secured the freedom in every state to marry the person we love but such progress is not inevitable its the result of choices we make together and we face such choices right now will we respond to the changes of our time with fear turning inward as a nation turning against each other as a people or will we face the future with confidence in who we are in what we stand for in the incredible things that we can do together so lets talk about the future and four big questions that i believe we as a country have to answer  regardless of who the next president is or who controls the next congress first how do we give everyone a fair shot at opportunity and security in this new economy applause second how do we make technology work for us and not against us  especially when it comes to solving urgent challenges like climate change applause third how do we keep america safe and lead the world without becoming its policeman applause and finally how can we make our politics reflect whats best in us and not whats worst let me start with the economy and a basic fact the united states of america right now has the strongest most durable economy in the world applause were in the middle of the longest streak of private sector job creation in history applause more than  million new jobs the strongest two years of job growth since the  an unemployment rate cut in half our auto industry just had its best year ever applause thats just part of a manufacturing surge thats created nearly  new jobs in the past six yearsand weve done all this while cutting our deficits by almost threequarters applause anyone claiming that americas economy is in decline is peddling fiction applause now what is true  and the reason that a lot of americans feel anxious  is that the economy has been changing in profound ways changes that started long before the great recession hit changes that have not let up today technology doesnt just replace jobs on the assembly line but any job where work can be automated companies in a global economy can locate anywhere and they face tougher competition as a result workers have less leverage for a raise companies have less loyalty to their communities and more and more wealth and income is concentrated at the very top all these trends have squeezed workers even when they have jobs even when the economy is growing its made it harder for a hardworking family to pull itself out of poverty harder for young people to start their careers tougher for workers to retire when they want to and although none of these trends are unique to america they do offend our uniquely american belief that everybody who works hard should get a fair shot for the past seven years our goal has been a growing economy that works also better for everybody weve made progress but we need to make more and despite all the political arguments that weve had these past few years there are actually some areas where americans broadly agree we agree that real opportunity requires every american to get the education and training they need to land a goodpaying job the bipartisan reform of no child left behind was an important start and together weve increased early childhood education lifted high school graduation rates to new highs boosted graduates in fields like engineering in the coming years we should build on that progress by providing prek for all and  applause  offering every student the handson computer science and math classes that make them jobready on day one we should recruit and support more great teachers for our kids applause and we have to make college affordable for every american applause no hardworking student should be stuck in the redweve already reduced student loan payments to  percent of a borrowers income and thats good but now weve actually got to cut the cost of college applause providing two years of community college at no cost for every responsible student is one of the best ways to do that and im going to keep fighting to get that started this year applause its the right thing to do applause but a great education isnt all we need in this new economy we also need benefits and protections that provide a basic measure of security its not too much of a stretch to say that some of the only people in america who are going to work the same job in the same place with a health and retirement package for  years are sitting in this chamber laughter for everyone else especially folks in their  and  saving for retirement or bouncing back from job loss has gotten a lot tougher americans understand that at some point in their careers in this new economy they may have to retool and they may have to retrain but they shouldnt lose what theyve already worked so hard to build in the process thats why social security and medicare are more important than ever we shouldnt weaken them we should strengthen themapplause and for americans short of retirement basic benefits should be just as mobile as everything else is today that by the way is what the affordable care act is all about its about filling the gaps in employerbased care so that when you lose a job or you go back to school or you strike out and launch that new business youll still have coverage nearly  million people have gained coverage so far applause and in the process health care inflation has slowedand our businesses have created jobs every single month since it became law now im guessing we wont agree on health care anytime soon applause a little applause right there laughter just a guess but there should be other ways parties can work together to improve economic security say a hardworking american loses his job  we shouldnt just make sure that he can get unemployment insurance we should make sure that program encourages him to retrain for a business thats ready to hire him if that new job doesnt pay as much there should be a system of wage insurance in place so that he can still pay his bills and even if hes going from job to job he should still be able to save for retirement and take his savings with him thats the way we make the new economy work better for everybody i also know speaker ryan has talked about his interest in tackling poverty america is about giving everybody willing to work a chance a hand up and id welcome a serious discussion about strategies we can all support like expanding tax cuts for lowincome workers who dont have children applause but there are some areas where we just have to be honest  it has been difficult to find agreement over the last seven years and a lot of them fall under the category of what role the government should play in making sure the systems not rigged in favor of the wealthiest and biggest corporations applause and its an honest disagreement and the american people have a choice to make i believe a thriving private sector is the lifeblood of our economy i think there are outdated regulations that need to be changed there is red tape that needs to be cut applause there you go yes applause but after years now of record corporate profits working families wont get more opportunity or bigger paychecks just by letting big banks or big oil or hedge funds make their own rules at everybody elses expense applause middleclass families are not going to feel more secure because we allowed attacks on collective bargaining to go unanswered food stamp recipients did not cause the financial crisis recklessness on wall street did applause immigrants arent the principal reason wages havent gone up those decisions are made in the boardrooms that all too often put quarterly earnings over longterm returns its sure not the average family watching tonight that avoids paying taxes through offshore accounts applause the point is i believe that in this new economy workers and startups and small businesses need more of a voice not less the rules should work for them applause and im not alone in this this year i plan to lift up the many businesses whove figured out that doing right by their workers or their customers or their communities ends up being good for their shareholders applause and i want to spread those best practices across america thats part of a brighter future applause in fact it turns out many of our best corporate citizens are also our most creative and this brings me to the second big question we as a country have to answer how do we reignite that spirit of innovation to meet our biggest challenges sixty years ago when the russians beat us into space we didnt deny sputnik was up there laughter we didnt argue about the science or shrink our research and development budget we built a space program almost overnight and  years later we were walking on the moon applause now that spirit of discovery is in our dna america is thomas edison and the wright brothers and george washington carver america is grace hopper and katherine johnson and sally ride america is every immigrant and entrepreneur from boston to austin to silicon valley racing to shape a better world applause thats who we are and over the past seven years weve nurtured that spirit weve protected an open internet and taken bold new steps to get more students and lowincome americans online applause weve launched nextgeneration manufacturing hubs and online tools that give an entrepreneur everything he or she needs to start a business in a single day but we can do so much more last year vice president biden said that with a new moonshotamerica can cure cancer last month he worked with this congress to give scientists at the national institutes of health the strongest resources that theyve had in over a decade applause so tonight im announcing a new national effort to get it done and because hes gone to the mat for all of us on so many issues over the past  years im putting joe in charge of mission control applause for the loved ones weve all lost for the families that we can still save lets make america the country that cures cancer once and for allapplause medical research is critical we need the same level of commitment when it comes to developing clean energy sources applauselook if anybody still wants to dispute the science around climate change have at it you will be pretty lonely because youll be debating our military most of americas business leaders the majority of the american people almost the entire scientific community and  nations around the world who agree its a problem and intend to solve it applause but even if  even if the planet wasnt at stake even if  wasnt the warmest year on record  until  turned out to be even hotter  why would we want to pass up the chance for american businesses to produce and sell the energy of the future applause listen seven years ago we made the single biggest investment in clean energy in our history here are the results in fields from iowa to texas wind power is now cheaper than dirtier conventional power on rooftops from arizona to new york solar is saving americans tens of millions of dollars a year on their energy bills and employs more americans than coal  in jobs that pay better than average were taking steps to give homeowners the freedom to generate and store their own energy  something by the way that environmentalists and tea partiers have teamed up to support and meanwhile weve cut our imports of foreign oil by nearly  percent and cut carbon pollution more than any other country on earth applause gas under two bucks a gallon aint bad either applause now weve got to accelerate the transition away from old dirtier energy sources rather than subsidize the past we should invest in the future  especially in communities that rely on fossil fuels we do them no favor when we dont show them where the trends are going thats why im going to push to change the way we manage our oil and coal resources so that they better reflect the costs they impose on taxpayers and our planet and that way we put money back into those communities and put tens of thousands of americans to work building a  century transportation system applause now none of this is going to happen overnight and yes there are plenty of entrenched interests who want to protect the status quo but the jobs well create the money well save the planet well preserve  that is the kind of future our kids and our grandkids deserve and its within our grasp climate change is just one of many issues where our security is linked to the rest of the world and thats why the third big question that we have to answer together is how to keep america safe and strong without either isolating ourselves or trying to nationbuild everywhere theres a problem i told you earlier all the talk of americas economic decline is political hot air well so is all the rhetoric you hear about our enemies getting stronger and america getting weaker let me tell you something the united states of america is the most powerful nation on earth period applause period its not even close its not even close applause its not even close we spend more on our military than the next eight nations combined our troops are the finest fighting force in the history of the world applause no nation attacks us directly or our allies because they know thats the path to ruin surveys show our standing around the world is higher than when i was elected to this office and when it comes to every important international issue people of the world do not look to beijing or moscow to lead  they call us applause i mean its useful to level the set here because when we dont we dont make good decisions now as someone who begins every day with an intelligence briefing i know this is a dangerous time but thats not primarily because of some looming superpower out there and certainly not because of diminished american strength in todays world were threatened less by evil empires and more by failing states the middle east is going through a transformation that will play out for a generation rooted in conflicts that date back millennia economic headwinds are blowing in from a chinese economy that is in significant transition even as their economy severely contracts russia is pouring resources in to prop up ukraine and syria  client states that they saw slipping away from their orbit and the international system we built after world war ii is now struggling to keep pace with this new reality its up to us the united states of america to help remake that system and to do that well it means that weve got to set priorities priority number one is protecting the american people and going after terrorist networks applause both al qaeda and now isil pose a direct threat to our people because in todays world even a handful of terrorists who place no value on human life including their own can do a lot of damage they use the internet to poison the minds of individuals inside our country their actions undermine and destabilize our allies we have to take them outp but as we focus on destroying isil overthetop claims that this is world war iii just play into their hands masses of fighters on the back of pickup trucks twisted souls plotting in apartments or garages  they pose an enormous danger to civilians they have to be stopped but they do not threaten our national existence applause that is the story isil wants to tell thats the kind of propaganda they use to recruit we dont need to build them up to show that were serious and we sure dont need to push away vital allies in this fight by echoing the lie that isil is somehow representative of one of the worlds largest religions applause we just need to call them what they are  killers and fanatics who have to be rooted out hunted down and destroyed applause and thats exactly what were doing for more than a year america has led a coalition of more than  countries to cut off isils financing disrupt their plots stop the flow of terrorist fighters and stamp out their vicious ideology with nearly  air strikes were taking out their leadership their oil their training camps their weapons were training arming and supporting forces who are steadily reclaiming territory in iraq and syria if this congress is serious about winning this war and wants to send a message to our troops and the world authorize the use of military force against isil take a vote applause take a vote but the american people should know that with or without congressional action isil will learn the same lessons as terrorists before them if you doubt americas commitment  or mine  to see that justice is done just ask osama bin laden applause ask the leader of al qaeda in yemen who was taken out last year or the perpetrator of the benghazi attacks who sits in a prison cell when you come after americans we go after you applause and it may take time but we have long memories and our reach has no limits applause our foreign policy hast to be focused on the threat from isil and al qaeda but it cant stop there for even without isil even without al qaeda instability will continue for decades in many parts of the world  in the middle east in afghanistan parts of pakistan in parts of central america in africa and asia some of these places may become safe havens for new terrorist networks others will just fall victim to ethnic conflict or famine feeding the next wave of refugees the world will look to us to help solve these problems and our answer needs to be more than tough talk or calls to carpetbomb civilians that may work as a tv sound bite but it doesnt pass muster on the world stage we also cant try to take over and rebuild every country that falls into crisis even if its done with the best of intentions applause thats not leadership thats a recipe for quagmire spilling american blood and treasure that ultimately will weaken us its the lesson of vietnam its the lesson of iraq  and we should have learned it by now applause fortunately there is a smarter approach a patient and disciplined strategy that uses every element of our national power it says america will always act alone if necessary to protect our people and our allies but on issues of global concern we will mobilize the world to work with us and make sure other countries pull their own weight thats our approach to conflicts like syria where were partnering with local forces and leading international efforts to help that broken society pursue a lasting peace thats why we built a global coalition with sanctions and principled diplomacy to prevent a nucleararmed iran and as we speak iran has rolled back its nuclear program shipped out its uranium stockpile and the world has avoided another war applause thats how we stopped the spread of ebola in west africa applause our military our doctors our development workers  they were heroic they set up the platform that then allowed other countries to join in behind us and stamp out that epidemic hundreds of thousands maybe a couple million lives were saved thats how we forged a transpacific partnership to open markets and protect workers and the environment and advance american leadership in asia it cuts  taxes on products made in america which will then support more good jobs here in america with tpp china does not set the rules in that region we do you want to show our strength in this new century approve this agreement give us the tools to enforce it its the right thing to do applause let me give you another example fifty years of isolating cuba had failed to promote democracy and set us back in latin america thats why we restored diplomatic relations  applause  opened the door to travel and commerce positioned ourselves to improve the lives of the cuban people applause so if you want to consolidate our leadership and credibility in the hemisphere recognize that the cold war is over  lift the embargo applause the point is american leadership in the  century is not a choice between ignoring the rest of the world  except when we kill terrorists  or occupying and rebuilding whatever society is unraveling leadership means a wise application of military power and rallying the world behind causes that are right it means seeing our foreign assistance as a part of our national security not something separate not charity when we lead nearly  nations to the most ambitious agreement in history to fight climate change yes that helps vulnerable countries but it also protects our kids when we help ukraine defend its democracy or colombia resolve a decadeslong war that strengthens the international order we depend on when we help african countries feed their people and care for the sick  applause  its the right thing to do and it prevents the next pandemic from reaching our shores right now were on track to end the scourge of hivaids thats within our grasp applause and we have the chance to accomplish the same thing with malaria  something ill be pushing this congress to fund this year applause thats american strength thats american leadership and that kind of leadership depends on the power of our example thats why i will keep working to shut down the prison at guantanamo applause it is expensive it is unnecessary and it only serves as a recruitment brochure for our enemies applause theres a better way applause and thats why we need to reject any politics  any politics  that targets people because of race or religion applause let me just say this this is not a matter of political correctness this is a matter of understanding just what it is that makes us strong the world respects us not just for our arsenal it respects us for our diversity and our openness and the way we respect every faith his holiness pope francis told this body from the very spot that im standing on tonight that to imitate the hatred and violence of tyrants and murderers is the best way to take their place when politicians insult muslims whether abroad or our fellow citizens when a mosque is vandalized or a kid is called names that doesnt make us safer thats not telling it like it is its just wrong applause it diminishes us in the eyes of the world it makes it harder to achieve our goals it betrays who we are as a country applause we the people our constitution begins with those three simple words words weve come to recognize mean all the people not just some words that insist we rise and fall together and thats how we might perfect our union and that brings me to the fourth and maybe the most important thing that i want to say tonight the future we want  all of us want  opportunity and security for our families a rising standard of living a sustainable peaceful planet for our kids  all that is within our reach but it will only happen if we work together it will only happen if we can have rational constructive debates it will only happen if we fix our politics a better politics doesnt mean we have to agree on everything this is a big country  different regions different attitudes different interests thats one of our strengths too our founders distributed power between states and branches of government and expected us to argue just as they did fiercely over the size and shape of government over commerce and foreign relations over the meaning of liberty and the imperatives of security but democracy does require basic bonds of trust between its citizens it doesnt work if we think the people who disagree with us are all motivated by malice it doesnt work if we think that our political opponents are unpatriotic or trying to weaken america democracy grinds to a halt without a willingness to compromise or when even basic facts are contested or when we listen only to those who agree with us our public life withers when only the most extreme voices get all the attention and most of all democracy breaks down when the average person feels their voice doesnt matter that the system is rigged in favor of the rich or the powerful or some special interest too many americans feel that way right now its one of the few regrets of my presidency  that the rancor and suspicion between the parties has gotten worse instead of better i have no doubt a president with the gifts of lincoln or roosevelt might have better bridged the divide and i guarantee ill keep trying to be better so long as i hold this office but my fellow americans this cannot be my task  or any presidents  alone there are a whole lot of folks in this chamber good people who would like to see more cooperation would like to see a more elevated debate in washington but feel trapped by the imperatives of getting elected by the noise coming out of your base i know youve told me its the worstkept secret in washington and a lot of you arent enjoying being trapped in that kind of rancor but that means if we want a better politics  and im addressing the american people now  if we want a better politics its not enough just to change a congressman or change a senator or even change a president we have to change the system to reflect our better selves i think weve got to end the practice of drawing our congressional districts so that politicians can pick their voters and not the other way around applause let a bipartisan group do it applause we have to reduce the influence of money in our politics so that a handful of families or hidden interests cant bankroll our elections applause and if our existing approach to campaign finance reform cant pass muster in the courts we need to work together to find a real solution  because its a problem and most of you dont like raising money i know ive done it applause weve got to make it easier to vote not harder applause we need to modernize it for the way we live now applause this is america we want to make it easier for people to participate and over the course of this year i intend to travel the country to push for reforms that do just that but i cant do these things on my own applause changes in our political process  in not just who gets elected but how they get elected  that will only happen when the american people demand it it depends on you thats whats meant by a government of by and for the people what im suggesting is hard its a lot easier to be cynical to accept that change is not possible and politics is hopeless and the problem is all the folks who are elected dont care and to believe that our voices and actions dont matter but if we give up now then we forsake a better future those with money and power will gain greater control over the decisions that could send a young soldier to war or allow another economic disaster or roll back the equal rights and voting rights that generations of americans have fought even died to secure and then as frustration grows there will be voices urging us to fall back into our respective tribes to scapegoat fellow citizens who dont look like us or pray like us or vote like we do or share the same background we cant afford to go down that path it wont deliver the economy we want it will not produce the security we want but most of all it contradicts everything that makes us the envy of the world so my fellow americans whatever you may believe whether you prefer one party or no party whether you supported my agenda or fought as hard as you could against it  our collective futures depends on your willingness to uphold your duties as a citizen to vote to speak out to stand up for others especially the weak especially the vulnerable knowing that each of us is only here because somebody somewhere stood up for us applause we need every american to stay active in our public life  and not just during election time  so that our public life reflects the goodness and the decency that i see in the american people every single day it is not easy our brand of democracy is hard but i can promise that a little over a year from now when i no longer hold this office i will be right there with you as a citizen inspired by those voices of fairness and vision of grit and good humor and kindness that helped america travel so far voices that help us see ourselves not first and foremost as black or white or asian or latino not as gay or straight immigrant or native born not as democrat or republican but as americans first bound by a common creed voices dr king believed would have the final word  voices of unarmed truth and unconditional love and theyre out there those voices they dont get a lot of attention they dont seek a lot of fanfare but theyre busy doing the work this country needs doing i see them everywhere i travel in this incredible country of ours i see you the american people and in your daily acts of citizenship i see our future unfolding i see it in the worker on the assembly line who clocked extra shifts to keep his company open and the boss who pays him higher wages instead of laying him off i see it in the dreamer who stays up late to finish her science project and the teacher who comes in early because he knows she might someday cure a disease i see it in the american who served his time and made mistakes as a child but now is dreaming of starting over  and i see it in the business owner who gives him that second chance the protester determined to prove that justice matters  and the young cop walking the beat treating everybody with respect doing the brave quiet work of keeping us safe applause i see it in the soldier who gives almost everything to save his brothers the nurse who tends to him till he can run a marathon the community that lines up to cheer him on its the son who finds the courage to come out as who he is and the father whose love for that son overrides everything hes been taught applause i see it in the elderly woman who will wait in line to cast her vote as long as she has to the new citizen who casts his vote for the first time the volunteers at the polls who believe every vote should count  because each of them in different ways know how much that precious right is worth thats the america i know thats the country we love cleareyed bighearted undaunted by challenge optimistic that unarmed truth and unconditional love will have the final word applause thats what makes me so hopeful about our future i believe in change because i believe in you the american people and thats why i stand here confident as i have ever been that the state of our union is strong applause thank you god bless you god bless the united states of america'"
