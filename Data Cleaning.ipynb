       "'Mr. Speaker and Mr. President, distinguished members of Congress, honored guests, and fellow citizens: Thank you very much for that warm reception. You know, with the big buildup this address has had, I wanted to make sure it would be a big hit, but I couldn\\'t convince Barbara to deliver it for me. I see the Speaker and the Vice President are laughing. They saw what I did in Japan, and they\\'re just happy they\\'re sitting behind me. I mean to speak tonight of big things, of big changes and the promises they hold, and of some big problems and how, together, we can solve them and move our country forward as the undisputed leader of the age. We gather tonight at a dramatic and deeply promising time in our history and in the history of man on Earth. For in the past 12 months, the world has known changes of almost biblical proportions. And even now, months after the failed coup that doomed a failed system, I\\'m not sure we\\'ve absorbed the full impact, the full import of what happened. But communism died this year. Even as President, with the most fascinating possible vantage point, there were times when I was so busy managing progress and helping to lead change that I didn\\'t always show the joy that was in my heart. But the biggest thing that has happened in the world in my life, in our lives, is this: By the grace of God, America won the Cold War. I mean to speak this evening of the changes that can take place in our country, now that we can stop making the sacrifices we had to make when we had an avowed enemy that was a superpower. Now we can look homeward even more and move to set right what needs to be set right. I will speak of those things. But let me tell you something I\\'ve been thinking these past few months. It\\'s a kind of rollcall of honor. For the Cold War didn\\'t end; it was won. And I think of those who won it, in places like Korea and Vietnam. And some of them didn\\'t come back. Back then they were heroes, but this year they were victors. The long rollcall, all the G.I. Joes and Janes, all the ones who fought faithfully for freedom, who hit the ground and sucked the dust and knew their share of horror. This may seem frivolous, and I don\\'t mean it so, but it\\'s moving to me how the world saw them. The world saw not only their special valor but their special style: their rambunctious, optimistic bravery, their do-or-die unity unhampered by class or race or region. What a group we\\'ve put forth, for generations now, from the ones who wrote \"Kilroy was here\" on the walls of the German stalags to those who left signs in the Iraqi desert that said, \"I saw Elvis.\" What a group of kids we\\'ve sent out into the world. And there\\'s another to be singled out, though it may seem inelegant, and I mean a mass of people called the American taxpayer. No one ever thinks to thank the people who pay a country\\'s bill or an alliance\\'s bill. But for half a century now, the American people have shouldered the burden and paid taxes that were higher than they would have been to support a defense that was bigger than it would have been if imperial communism had never existed. But it did; doesn\\'t anymore. And here\\'s a fact I wouldn\\'t mind the world acknowledging: The American taxpayer bore the brunt of the burden and deserves a hunk of the glory. So now, for the first time in 35 years, our strategic bombers stand down. No longer are they on \\'round-the-clock alert. Tomorrow our children will go to school and study history and how plants grow. And they won\\'t have, as my children did, air raid drills in which they crawl under their desks and cover their heads in case of nuclear war. My grandchildren don\\'t have to do that and won\\'t have the bad dreams children had once, in decades past. There are still threats. But the long, drawn-out dread is over. A year ago tonight, I spoke to you at a moment of high peril. American forces had just unleashed Operation Desert Storm. And after 40 days in the desert skies and four days on the ground, the men and women of America\\'s armed forces and our allies accomplished the goals that I declared and that you endorsed: We liberated Kuwait. Soon after, the Arab world and Israel sat down to talk seriously and comprehensively about peace, an historic first. And soon after that, at Christmas, the last American hostages came home. Our policies were vindicated. Much good can come from the prudent use of power. And much good can come of this: A world once divided into two armed camps now recognizes one sole and preeminent power, the United States of America. And they regard this with no dread. For the world trusts us with power, and the world is right. They trust us to be fair and restrained. They trust us to be on the side of decency. They trust us to do what\\'s right. I use those words advisedly. A few days after the war began, I received a telegram from Joanne Speicher, the wife of the first pilot killed in the Gulf, Lieutenant Commander Scott Speicher. Even in her grief, she wanted me to know that some day when her children were old enough, she would tell them \"that their father went away to war because it was the right thing to do.\" And she said it all: It was the right thing to do. And we did it together. There were honest differences right here in this chamber. But when the war began, you put partisanship aside, and we supported our troops. This is still a time for pride, but this is no time to boast. For problems face us, and we must stand together once again and solve them and not let our country down. Two years ago, I began planning cuts in military spending that reflected the changes of the new era. But now, this year, with imperial communism gone, that process can be accelerated. Tonight I can tell you of dramatic changes in our strategic nuclear force. These are actions we are taking on our own because they are the right thing to do. After completing 20 planes for which we have begun procurement, we will shut down further production of the B-2 bombers. We will cancel the small ICBM program. We will cease production of new warheads for our sea-based ballistic missiles. We will stop all new production of the Peacekeeper missile. And we will not purchase any more advanced cruise missiles. This weekend I will meet at Camp David with Boris Yeltsin of the Russian Federation. I\\'ve informed President Yeltsin that if the Commonwealth, the former Soviet Union, will eliminate all land-based multiple-warhead ballistic missiles, I will do the following: We will eliminate all Peacekeeper missiles. We will reduce the number of warheads on Minuteman missiles to one and reduce the number of warheads on our sea-based missiles by about one-third. And we will convert a substantial portion of our strategic bombers to primarily conventional use. President Yeltsin\\'s early response has been very positive, and I expect our talks at Camp David to be fruitful. I want you to know that for half a century, American Presidents have longed to make such decisions and say such words. But even in the midst of celebration, we must keep caution as a friend. For the world is still a dangerous place. Only the dead have seen the end of conflict. And though yesterday\\'s challenges are behind us, tomorrow\\'s are being born. The Secretary of Defense recommended these cuts after consultation with the Joint Chiefs of Staff. And I make them with confidence. But do not misunderstand me. The reductions I have approved will save us an additional $50 billion over the next five years. By 1997, we will have cut defense by 30 percent since I took office. These cuts are deep, and you must know my resolve: This deep, and no deeper. To do less would be insensible to progress, but to do more would be ignorant of history. We must not go back to the days of \"the hollow army.\" We cannot repeat the mistakes made twice in this century when armistice was followed by recklessness and defense was purged as if the world were permanently safe. I remind you this evening that I have asked for your support in funding a program to protect our country from limited nuclear missile attack. We must have this protection because too many people in too many countries have access to nuclear arms. And I urge you again to pass the Strategic Defense Initiative, SDI. There are those who say that now we can turn away from the world, that we have no special role, no special place. But we are the United States of America, the leader of the West that has become the leader of the world. And as long as I am President, I will continue to lead in support of freedom everywhere, not out of arrogance, not out of altruism, but for the safety and security of our children. This is a fact: Strength in the pursuit of peace is no vice; isolationism in the pursuit of security is no virtue. And now to our troubles at home. They\\'re not all economic; the primary problem is our economy. There are some good signs. Inflation, that thief, is down. And interest rates are down. But unemployment is too high, some industries are in trouble, and growth is not what it should be. Let me tell you right from the start and right from the heart, I know we\\'re in hard times. But I know something else: This will not stand. In this chamber, in this chamber we can bring the same courage and sense of common purpose to the economy that we brought to Desert Storm. And we can defeat hard times together. I believe you\\'ll help. One reason is that you\\'re patriots, and you want the best for your country. And I believe that in your hearts you want to put partisanship aside and get the job done because it\\'s the right thing to do. The power of America rests in a stirring but simple idea, that people will do great things if only you set them free. Well, we\\'re going to set the economy free. For if this age of miracles and wonders has taught us anything, it\\'s that if we can change the world we can change America. We must encourage investment. We must make it easier for people to invest money and create new products, new industries, and new jobs. We must clear away the obstacles to growth: high taxes, high regulation, redtape, and yes, wasteful government spending. None of this will happen with a snap of the fingers, but it will happen. And the test of a plan isn\\'t whether it\\'s called new or dazzling. The American people aren\\'t impressed by gimmicks; they\\'re smarter on this score than all of us in this room. The only test of a plan is: Is it sound, and will it work? We must have a short-term plan to address our immediate needs and heat up the economy. And then we need a longer term plan to keep combustion going and to guarantee our place in the world economy. There are certain things that a President can do without Congress, and I\\'m going to do them. I have, this evening, asked major Cabinet departments and federal agencies to institute a 90-day moratorium on any new federal regulations that could hinder growth. In those 90 days, major departments and agencies will carry out a top-to-bottom review of all regulations, old and new, to stop the ones that will hurt growth and speed up those that will help growth. Further, for the untold number of hard-working, responsible American workers and business men and women who\\'ve been forced to go without needed bank loans, the banking credit crunch must end. I won\\'t neglect my responsibility for sound regulations that serve the public good, but regulatory overkill must be stopped. And I\\'ve instructed our government regulators to stop it. I have directed Cabinet departments and federal agencies to speed up progrowth expenditures as quickly as possible. This should put an extra $10 billion into the economy in the next six months. And our new transportation bill provides more than $150 billion for construction and maintenance projects that are vital to our growth and well-being. And that means jobs building roads, jobs building bridges, and jobs building railways. And I have, this evening, directed the Secretary of the Treasury to change the federal tax withholding tables. With this change, millions of Americans from whom the government withholds more than necessary can now choose to have the government withhold less from their paychecks. Something tells me a number of taxpayers may take us up on this one. This initiative could return about $25 billion back into our economy over the next 12 months, money people can use to help pay for clothing, college, or to get a new car. Finally, working with the Federal Reserve, we will continue to support monetary policy that keeps both interest rates and inflation down. Now, these are the things I can do. And now, members of Congress, let me tell you what you can do for your country. You must pass the other elements of my plan to meet our economic needs. Everyone knows that investment spurs recovery. I am proposing this evening a change in the alternative minimum tax and the creation of a new 15-percent investment tax allowance. This will encourage businesses to accelerate investment and bring people back to work. Real estate has led our economy out of almost all the tough times we\\'ve ever had. Once building starts, carpenters and plumbers work; people buy homes and take out mortgages. My plan would modify the passive loss rule for active real estate developers. And it would make it easier for pension plans to purchase real estate. For those Americans who dream of buying a first home but who can\\'t quite afford it, my plan would allow first-time homebuyers to withdraw savings from IRAs without penalty and provide a $5,000 tax credit for the first purchase of that home. And finally, my immediate plan calls on Congress to give crucial help to people who own a home, to everyone who has a business or a farm or a single investment. This time, at this hour, I cannot take no for an answer. You must cut the capital gains tax on the people of our country. Never has an issue been more demagogued by its opponents. But the demagogs are wrong. They are wrong, and they know it. Sixty percent of the people who benefit from lower capital gains have incomes under $50,000. A cut in the capital gains tax increases jobs and helps just about everyone in our country. And so, I\\'m asking you to cut the capital gains tax to a maximum of 15.4 percent. I\\'ll tell you, those of you who say, \"Oh, no, someone who\\'s comfortable may benefit from that,\" you kind of remind me of the old definition of the Puritan who couldn\\'t sleep at night, worrying that somehow, someone somewhere was out having a good time. [Laughter] The opponents of this measure and those who have authored various so-called soak-the-rich bills that are floating around this chamber should be reminded of something: When they aim at the big guy, they usually hit the little guy. And maybe it\\'s time that stopped. This, then, is my short-term plan. Your part, members of Congress, requires enactment of these commonsense proposals that will have a strong effect on the economy without breaking the budget agreement and without raising tax rates. While my plan is being passed and kicking in, we\\'ve got to care for those in trouble today. I have provided for up to $4.4 billion in my budget to extend federal unemployment benefits. And I ask for congressional action right away. And I thank the committee. [Applause] Well, at last. Let\\'s be frank. Let\\'s be frank. Let me level with you. I know and you know that my plan is unveiled in a political season. [Laughter] I know and you know that everything I propose will be viewed by some in merely partisan terms. But I ask you to know what is in my heart. And my aim is to increase our nation\\'s good. I\\'m doing what I think is right, and I am proposing what I know will help. I pride myself that I\\'m a prudent man, and I believe that patience is a virtue. But I understand that politics is, for some, a game and that sometimes the game is to stop all progress and then decry the lack of improvement. [Laughter] But let me tell you: Far more important than my political future and far more important than yours is the well-being of our country. Members of this chamber are practical people, and I know you won\\'t resent some practical advice. When people put their party\\'s fortunes, whatever the party, whatever side of this aisle, before the public good, they court defeat not only for their country but for themselves. And they will certainly deserve it. I submit my plan tomorrow, and I\\'m asking you to pass it by March 20. And I ask the American people to let you know they want this action by March 20. From the day after that, if it must be, the battle is joined. And you know, when principle is at stake I relish a good, fair fight. I said my plan has two parts, and it does. And it\\'s the second part that is the heart of the matter. For it\\'s not enough to get an immediate burst. We need long-term improvement in our economic position. We all know that the key to our economic future is to ensure that America continues as an economic leader of the world. We have that in our power. Here, then, is my long-term plan to guarantee our future. First, trade: We will work to break down the walls that stop world trade. We will work to open markets everywhere. And in our major trade negotiations, I will continue pushing to eliminate tariffs and subsidies that damage America\\'s farmers and workers. And we\\'ll get more good American jobs within our own hemisphere through the North American free trade agreement and through the Enterprise for the Americas Initiative. But changes are here, and more are coming. The workplace of the future will demand more highly skilled workers than ever, more people who are computer-literate, highly educated. We must be the world\\'s leader in education. And we must revolutionize America\\'s schools. My America 2000 strategy will help us reach that goal. My plan will give parents more choice, give teachers more flexibility, and help communities create new American schools. Thirty states across the nation have established America 2000 programs. Hundreds of cities and towns have joined in. Now Congress must join this great movement: Pass my proposals for new American schools. That was my second long-term proposal, and here\\'s my third: We must make commonsense investments that will help us compete, long-term, in the marketplace. We must encourage research and development. My plan is to make the R&D tax credit permanent and to provide record levels of support, over $76 billion this year alone, for people who will explore the promise of emerging technologies. Fourth, we must do something about crime and drugs. It is time for a major, renewed investment in fighting violent street crime. It saps our strength and hurts our faith in our society and in our future together. Surely a tired woman on her way to work at 6 in the morning on a subway deserves the right to get there safely. And surely it\\'s true that everyone who changes his or her life because of crime, from those afraid to go out at night to those afraid to walk in the parks they pay for, surely these people have been denied a basic civil right. It is time to restore it. Congress, pass my comprehensive crime bill. It is tough on criminals and supportive of police, and it has been languishing in these hallowed halls for years now. Pass it. Help your country. Fifth, I ask you tonight to fund our HOPE housing proposal and to pass my enterprise zone legislation which will get businesses into the inner city. We must empower the poor with the pride that comes from owning a home, getting a job, becoming a part of things. My plan would encourage real estate construction by extending tax incentives for mortgage revenue bonds and low-income housing. And I ask tonight for record expenditures for the program that helps children born into want move into excellence, Head Start. Step six, we must reform our health care system. For this, too, bears on whether or not we can compete in the world. American health costs have been exploding. This year America will spend over $800 billion on health, and that is expected to grow to $1.6 trillion by the end of the decade. We simply cannot afford this. The cost of health care shows up not only in your family budget but in the price of everything we buy and everything we sell. When health coverage for a fellow on an assembly line costs thousands of dollars, the cost goes into the products he makes, and you pay the bill. We must make a choice. Now, some pretend we can have it both ways. They call it \"play or pay,\" but that expensive approach is unstable. It will mean higher taxes, fewer jobs, and eventually a system under complete government control. Really, there are only two options. And we can move toward a nationalized system, a system which will restrict patient choice in picking a doctor and force the government to ration services arbitrarily. And what we\\'ll get is patients in long lines, indifferent service, and a huge new tax burden. Or we can reform our own private health care system, which still gives us, for all its flaws, the best quality health care in the world. Well, let\\'s build on our strengths. My plan provides insurance security for all Americans while preserving and increasing the idea of choice. We make basic health insurance affordable for all low-income people not now covered, and we do it by providing a health insurance tax credit of up to $3,750 for each low-income family. And the middle class gets help, too. And by reforming the health insurance market, my plan assures that Americans will have access to basic health insurance even if they change jobs or develop serious health problems. We must bring costs under control, preserve quality, preserve choice, and reduce the people\\'s nagging daily worry about health insurance. My plan, the details of which I\\'ll announce very shortly, does just that. Seventh, we must get the federal deficit under control. We now have, in law, enforceable spending caps and a requirement that we pay for the programs we create. There are those in Congress who would ease that discipline now. But I cannot let them do it, and I won\\'t. My plan would freeze all domestic discretionary budget authority, which means no more next year than this year. I will not tamper with Social Security, but I would put real caps on the growth of uncontrolled spending. And I would also freeze federal domestic government employment. And with the help of Congress, my plan will get rid of 246 programs that don\\'t deserve federal funding. Some of them have noble titles, but none of them is indispensable. We can get rid of each and every one of them. You know, it\\'s time we rediscovered a home truth the American people have never forgotten: This government is too big and spends too much. And I call upon Congress to adopt a measure that will help put an end to the annual ritual of filling the budget with pork barrel appropriations. Every year, the press has a field day making fun of outrageous examples: a Lawrence Welk museum, research grants for Belgian endive. We all know how these things get into the budget, and maybe you need someone to help you say no. I know how to say it, and I know what I need to make it stick. Give me the same thing 43 Governors have, the line-item veto, and let me help you control spending. We must put an end to unfinanced federal government mandates. These are the requirements Congress puts on our cities, counties, and states without supplying the money. If Congress passes a mandate, it should be forced to pay for it and balance the cost with savings elsewhere. After all, a mandate just increases someone else\\'s burden, and that means higher taxes at the state and local level. Step eight, Congress should enact the bold reform proposals that are still awaiting congressional action: bank reform, civil justice reform, tort reform, and my national energy strategy. And finally, we must strengthen the family because it is the family that has the greatest bearing on our future. When Barbara holds an AIDS baby in her arms and reads to children, she\\'s saying to every person in this country: Family matters. And I am announcing tonight a new Commission on America\\'s Urban Families. I\\'ve asked Missouri\\'s Governor John Ashcroft to be Chairman, former Dallas Mayor Annette Strauss to be Cochair. You know, I had mayors, the leading mayors from the League of Cities, in the other day at the White House, and they told me something striking. They said that every one of them, Republican or Democrat, agreed on one thing, that the major cause of the problems of the cities is the dissolution of the family. They asked for this Commission, and they were right to ask because it\\'s time to determine what we can do to keep families together, strong and sound. There\\'s one thing we can do right away: Ease the burden of rearing a child. I ask you tonight to raise the personal exemption by $500 per child for every family. For a family with four kids, that\\'s an increase of $2,000. This is a good start in the right direction, and it\\'s what we can afford. It\\'s time to allow families to deduct the interest they pay on student loans. I am asking you to do just that. And I\\'m asking you to allow people to use money from their IRAs to pay medical and education expenses, all without penalties. And I\\'m asking for more. Ask American parents what they dislike about how things are going in our country, and chances are good that pretty soon they\\'ll get to welfare. Americans are the most generous people on Earth. But we have to go back to the insight of Franklin Roosevelt who, when he spoke of what became the welfare program, warned that it must not become \"a narcotic\" and a \"subtle destroyer\" of the spirit. Welfare was never meant to be a lifestyle. It was never meant to be a habit. It was never supposed to be passed from generation to generation like a legacy. It\\'s time to replace the assumptions of the welfare state and help reform the welfare system. States throughout the country are beginning to operate with new assumptions that when able-bodied people receive government assistance, they have responsibilities to the taxpayer: A responsibility to seek work, education, or job training; a responsibility to get their lives in order; a responsibility to hold their families together and refrain from having children out of wedlock; and a responsibility to obey the law. We are going to help this movement. Often, state reform requires waiving certain federal regulations. I will act to make that process easier and quicker for every state that asks for our help. I want to add, as we make these changes, we work together to improve this system, that our intention is not scapegoating or finger-pointing. If you read the papers and watch TV, you know there\\'s been a rise these days in a certain kind of ugliness: racist comments, anti-Semitism, an increased sense of division. Really, this is not us. This is not who we are. And this is not acceptable. And so, you have my plan for America. And I\\'m asking for big things, but I believe in my heart you\\'ll do what\\'s right. You know, it\\'s kind of an American tradition to show a certain skepticism toward our democratic institutions. I myself have sometimes thought the aging process could be delayed if it had to make its way through Congress. [Laughter] You will deliberate, and you will discuss, and that is fine. But, my friends, the people cannot wait. They need help now. There\\'s a mood among us. People are worried. There\\'s been talk of decline. Someone even said our workers are lazy and uninspired. And I thought: Really? You go tell Neil Armstrong standing on the moon. Tell the men and women who put him there. Tell the American farmer who feeds his country and the world. Tell the men and women of Desert Storm. Moods come and go, but greatness endures. Ours does. And maybe for a moment it\\'s good to remember what, in the dailiness of our lives, we forget: We are still and ever the freest nation on Earth, the kindest nation on Earth, the strongest nation on Earth. And we have always risen to the occasion. And we are going to lift this nation out of hard times inch by inch and day by day, and those who would stop us had better step aside. Because I look at hard times, and I make this vow: This will not stand. And so, we move on together, a rising nation, the once and future miracle that is still, this night, the hope of the world. Thank you. God bless you, and God bless our beloved country. Thank you very, very much. \\xa0'"

that because it’s an election season expectations for what we will achieve this year are low\\xa0but mr speaker i appreciate the constructive approach that you and the other leaderstook at the end of last year to\\xa0pass a budget\\xa0and\\xa0make\\xa0tax cuts permanent\\xa0for working families so i hope we can work together this year on some bipartisan priorities like\\xa0criminal justice reform\\xa0 applause  and helping people who are battling prescription drug abuse and heroin abuse applause so who knows we might surprise the cynics again but tonight i want to go easy on the traditional list of proposals for the year ahead don’t worry i’ve got plenty from\\xa0helping students learn to write computer code\\xa0to\\xa0personalizing medical treatments for patients and i will keep pushing for progress on the work that i believe still needs to be done\\xa0fixing a broken immigration system applause\\xa0protecting our kids from gun violence applauseequal pay for equal work applause\\xa0paid leave applauseraising the minimum wage applause all these things still matter to hardworking families they’re still the right thing to do and i wont let up until they get done but for my final address to this chamber i don’t want to just talk about next year i want to focus on the next five years the next  years and beyond\\xa0i want to focus on our future we live in a time of extraordinary change  change that’s reshaping the way we live the way we work our planet our place in the world it’s change that promises amazing medical breakthroughs but also economic disruptions that strain working families it\\xa0promises education for girls in the most remote villages\\xa0but also connects terrorists plotting an ocean away it’s change that can broaden opportunity or widen inequality and whether we like it or not the pace of this change will only accelerate \\xa0america has been through big changes before  wars and depression the\\xa0influx of new immigrants workers fighting for a fair deal movements to expand civil rights\\xa0each time there have been those who told us to fear the future who claimed we could slam the brakes on change who promised to restore past glory if we just got some group or idea that was threatening america under control and each time we overcame those fears\\xa0we did not in the words of lincoln adhere to the “dogmas of the quiet past” instead we thought anew and acted anew\\xa0we made change work for us always extending america’s promise outward to the next frontier to more people and because we did  because we saw opportunity where others saw only peril  we emerged stronger and better than before what was true then can be true now our unique strengths as a nation  our optimism and work ethic our spirit of discovery our diversity our commitment to rule of law  these things give us everything we need to ensure prosperity and security for generations to come in fact it’s that spirit that made the progress of these past seven years possible\\xa0 it’s how we recovered from the worst economic crisis in generations\\xa0 it’s how we reformed our health care system and reinvented our energy sector how we delivered more care and benefits to our troops and veterans and\\xa0how we secured the freedom in every state to marry the person we love but such progress is not inevitable it’s the result of choices we make together and we face such choices right now will we respond to the changes of our time with fear turning inward as a nation turning against each other as a people or will we face the future with confidence in who we are in what we stand for in the incredible things that we can do together so let’s talk about the future and four big questions that i believe we as a country have to answer  regardless of who the next president is or who controls the next congress first how do we give everyone a fair shot at opportunity and security in this new economy\\xa0applause second how do we make technology work for us and not against us  especially when it comes to solving urgent challenges like climate change\\xa0applause third how do we keep america safe and lead the world without becoming its policeman\\xa0applause and finally how can we make our politics reflect what’s best in us and not what’s worst let me start with the economy and a basic fact\\xa0the united states of america right now\\xa0has the strongest most durable economy in the world\\xa0applause\\xa0we’re in the middle of the longest streak of private sector job creation in history\\xa0applause\\xa0more than  million new jobs the strongest two years of job growth since the ‘ an unemployment rate cut in half\\xa0our auto industry just had its best year ever applause thats just part of a manufacturing surge thats created nearly  new jobs in the past six yearsand we’ve done all this while cutting our deficits by almost threequarters\\xa0applause anyone claiming that america’s economy is in decline is peddling fiction applause now what is true  and the reason that a lot of americans feel anxious\\xa0 is that the economy has been changing in profound ways changes that started long\\xa0before the\\xa0great recession hit changes that have not let up today technology doesn’t just replace jobs on the assembly line but any job where work can be automated\\xa0companies in a global economy can locate anywhere and they face tougher competition as a result workers have less leverage for a raise\\xa0companies have less loyalty to their communities and more and more wealth and income is concentrated at the very top all these trends have squeezed workers even when they have jobs even when the economy is growing it’s made it harder for a hardworking family to pull itself out of poverty harder for young people to start their careers tougher for workers to retire when they want to and although none of these trends are unique to america they do offend our uniquely american belief that everybody who works hard should get a fair shot for the past seven years our goal has been a growing economy that works also better for everybody we’ve made progress but we need to make more and despite all the political arguments that we’ve had these past few years there are actually some areas where americans broadly agree we agree that real opportunity requires every american to get the education and training they need to land a goodpaying job\\xa0the bipartisan reform of no child left behind was an important start and together we’ve increased early childhood education\\xa0lifted high school graduation rates to new highs\\xa0boosted graduates in fields like engineering in the coming years we should build on that progress by providing prek for all and  applause  offering every student the handson computer science and math classes that make them jobready on day one we should recruit and support more great teachers for our kids applause and we have to make college affordable for every american applause no hardworking student should be\\xa0stuck in the redwe’ve already reduced student loan payments to  percent of a borrower’s income and thats good but now we’ve actually got to cut the cost of college\\xa0applause\\xa0providing two years of community college at no cost for every responsible student is one of the best ways to do that and i’m going to keep fighting to get that started this year applause its the right thing to do applause but a great education isn’t all we need in this new economy we also need benefits and protections that provide a basic measure of security it’s not too much of a stretch to say that some of the only people in america who are going to work the same job in the same place with a health and retirement package for  years are sitting in this chamber laughter for everyone else especially folks in their  and  saving for retirement or bouncing back from job loss has gotten a lot tougher americans understand that at some point in their careers in this new economy they may have to retool and they may have to retrain but they shouldn’t lose what they’ve already worked so hard to build in the process that’s why social security and medicare are more important than ever we shouldn’t weaken them we should strengthen themapplause and for americans short of retirement basic benefits should be just as mobile as everything else is today\\xa0that by the way is what the affordable care act is all about\\xa0it’s about filling the gaps in employerbased care so that when you lose a job or you go back to school or you strike out and launch that new business you’ll still have coverage nearly  million people have gained coverage so far applause and in the process health care inflation has slowedand our businesses have created jobs every single month since it became law now i’m guessing we won’t agree on health care anytime soon applause a little applause right there laughter just a guess but there should be other ways parties can work together to improve economic security say a hardworking american loses his job  we shouldn’t just make sure that he can get unemployment insurance we should make sure that program encourages him to retrain for a business that’s ready to hire him if that new job doesn’t pay as much there should be a system of wage insurance in place so that he can still pay his bills and even if he’s going from job to job he should still be able to save for retirement and take his savings with him that’s the way we make the new economy work better for everybody i also know speaker ryan has talked about his interest in tackling poverty america is about giving everybody willing to work a chance a hand up\\xa0and i’d welcome a serious discussion about strategies we can all support like expanding tax cuts for lowincome workers who dont have children\\xa0applause but there are some areas where we just have to be honest  it has been difficult to find agreement over the last seven years and a lot of them fall under the category of what role the government should play in making sure the system’s not rigged in favor of the wealthiest and biggest corporations applause and its an honest disagreement and the american people have a choice to make i believe a thriving private sector is the lifeblood of our economy i think there are outdated regulations that need to be changed there is red tape that needs to be cut applause there you go yes applause but after years now of record corporate profits working families won’t get more opportunity or bigger paychecks just by letting big banks or big oil or hedge funds make their own rules at everybody else’s expense applause middleclass families are not going to feel more secure because we allowed attacks on collective bargaining to go unanswered food stamp recipients did not cause the financial crisis recklessness on wall street did applause immigrants aren’t the principal reason wages haven’t gone up those decisions are made in the boardrooms that all too often put quarterly earnings over longterm returns it’s sure not the average family watching tonight that avoids paying taxes through offshore accounts applause the point is i believe that in this new economy workers and startups and small businesses need more of a voice not less the rules should work for them applause and im not alone in this this year i plan to lift up the many businesses who’ve figured out that doing right by their workers or their customers or their communities ends up being good for their shareholders applause and i want to spread those best practices across america thats part of a brighter future applause in fact it turns out many of our best corporate citizens are also our most creative and this brings me to the second big question we as a country have to answer how do we reignite that spirit of innovation to meet our biggest challenges sixty years ago when the russians beat us into space we didn’t deny sputnik was up there laughter we didn’t argue about the science or shrink our research and development budget\\xa0we built a space program almost overnight and  years later we were walking on the moon\\xa0applause now that spirit of discovery is in our dna america is thomas edison and the wright brothers\\xa0and george washington carver america is grace hopper and katherine johnson and sally ride america is every immigrant and entrepreneur from boston to austin to silicon valley racing to shape a better world applause thats who we are and over the past seven years we’ve nurtured that spirit\\xa0we’ve protected an open internet and taken bold new steps to get more students and lowincome americans online applause we’ve launched nextgeneration manufacturing hubs and online tools that give an entrepreneur everything he or she needs to start a business in a single day but we can do so much more last year vice president biden said that with a new moonshotamerica can cure cancer\\xa0last month he worked with this congress to give scientists at the national institutes of health the strongest resources that they’ve had in over a decade applause so tonight i’m announcing a new national effort to get it done and because he’s gone to the mat for all of us on so many issues over the past  years\\xa0i’m putting joe in charge of mission control applause\\xa0for the loved ones we’ve all lost for the families that we can still save let’s make america the country that cures cancer once and for allapplause medical research is critical we need the same level of commitment when it comes to developing clean energy sources applauselook if anybody still wants to dispute the science around climate change have at it you will be pretty lonely because you’ll be debating our military most of america’s business leaders the majority of the american people almost the entire scientific community and  nations around the world who agree it’s a problem and intend to solve it\\xa0applause but even if  even if the planet wasn’t at stake even if  wasn’t the warmest year on record  until  turned out to be even hotter  why would we want to pass up the chance for american businesses to produce and sell the energy of the future applause listen seven years ago we made the single biggest investment in clean energy in our history here are the results in fields from iowa to texas wind power is now cheaper than dirtier conventional power on rooftops from arizona to new york solar is saving americans tens of millions of dollars a year on their energy bills and employs more americans than coal  in jobs that pay better than average we’re taking steps to give homeowners the freedom to generate and store their own energy  something by the way that environmentalists and tea partiers have teamed up to support and meanwhile we’ve cut our imports of foreign oil by nearly  percent and cut carbon pollution more than any other country on earth applause gas under two bucks a gallon ain’t bad either\\xa0applause now we’ve got to accelerate the transition away from old dirtier energy sources rather than subsidize the past we should invest in the future  especially in communities that rely on fossil fuels we do them no favor when we dont show them where the trends are going that’s why i’m going to push to change the way we manage our oil and coal resources so that they better reflect the costs they impose on taxpayers and our planet and that way we put money back into those communities and put tens of thousands of americans to work building a  century transportation system applause now none of this is going to happen overnight and yes there are plenty of entrenched interests who want to protect the status quo but the jobs we’ll create the money we’ll save the planet we’ll preserve  that is the kind of future our kids and our grandkids deserve and its within our grasp climate change is just one of many issues where our security is linked to the rest of the world\\xa0and that’s why the third big question that we have to answer together is how to keep america safe and strong without either isolating ourselves or trying to nationbuild everywhere there’s a problem i told you earlier all the talk of america’s economic decline is political hot air well so is all the rhetoric you hear about our enemies getting stronger and america getting weaker let me tell you something the united states of america is the most powerful nation on earth period applause period it’s not even close its not even close applause its not even close we spend more on our military than the next eight nations combined our troops are the finest fighting force in the history of the world applause no nation attacks us directly or our allies because they know that’s the path to ruin\\xa0surveys show our standing around the world is higher than when i was elected to this office and when it comes to every important international issue people of the world do not look to beijing or moscow to lead  they call us\\xa0applause i mean its useful to level the set here because when we dont we dont make good decisions now as someone who begins every day with\\xa0an intelligence briefing i know this is a dangerous time but that’s not primarily because of some looming superpower out there and certainly not because of diminished american strength in today’s world we’re threatened less by evil empires and more by failing states the middle east is going through a transformation that will play out for a generation rooted in conflicts that date back millennia economic headwinds are blowing in from a chinese economy that is in significant transition even as their economy severely contracts russia is pouring resources in to prop up ukraine and syria  client states that they saw slipping away from their orbit\\xa0and the international system we built after world war ii is now struggling to keep pace with this new reality it’s up to us the united states of america to help remake that system\\xa0and to do that well it means that we’ve got to set priorities priority number one is protecting the american people and going after terrorist networks applause both al qaeda and now isil pose a direct threat to our people because in today’s world even a handful of terrorists who place no value on human life including their own can do a lot of damage they use the internet to poison the minds of individuals inside our country\\xa0their actions undermine and destabilize our allies\\xa0we have to take them outp but as we focus on destroying isil overthetop claims that this is world war iii just play into their hands masses of fighters on the back of pickup trucks twisted souls plotting in apartments or garages  they pose an enormous danger to civilians they have to be stopped but they do not threaten our national existence applause that is the story isil wants to tell that’s the kind of propaganda they use to recruit we don’t need to build them up to show that we’re serious and we sure dont need to push away vital allies in this fight by echoing the lie that isil is somehow representative of one of the world’s largest religions applause we just need to call them what they are  killers and fanatics who have to be rooted out hunted down and destroyed applause and that’s exactly what we’re doing\\xa0for more than a year america has led a coalition of more than  countries to cut off isil’s financing disrupt their plots\\xa0stop the flow of terrorist fighters and stamp out their vicious ideology with nearly  air strikes we’re taking out their leadership their oil their training camps their weapons\\xa0we’re training arming and supporting forces who are steadily reclaiming territory in iraq and syria if this congress is serious about winning this war and wants to send a message to our troops and the world authorize the use of military force against isil take a vote applause take a vote but the american people should know that with or without\\xa0congressional action isil will learn the same lessons as terrorists before them\\xa0if you doubt america’s commitment  or mine  to see that justice is done just ask osama bin laden\\xa0applause ask the leader of al qaeda in yemen who was taken out last year or the perpetrator of the benghazi attacks who sits in a prison cell when you come after americans we go after you applause and it may take time but we have long memories and our reach has no limits applause our foreign policy hast to be focused on the threat from isil and al qaeda but it can’t stop there for even without isil even without al qaeda instability will continue for decades in many parts of the world  in the middle east in afghanistan parts of pakistan in parts of central america in africa and asia some of these places may become safe havens for new terrorist networks others will just fall victim to ethnic conflict or famine feeding the next wave of refugees the world will look to us to help solve these problems and our answer needs to be more than tough talk or calls to carpetbomb civilians that may work as a tv sound bite but it doesn’t pass muster on the world stage we also can’t try to take over and rebuild every country that falls into crisis even if its done with the best of intentions applause that’s not leadership that’s a recipe for quagmire spilling american blood and treasure that ultimately will weaken us it’s the lesson of vietnam its the lesson of iraq  and we should have learned it by now applause fortunately there is a smarter approach a patient and disciplined strategy that uses every element of our national power it says america will always act alone if necessary to protect our people and our allies but on issues of global concern we will mobilize the world to work with us and make sure other countries pull their own weight that’s our approach to conflicts like syria where we’re partnering with local forces and leading international efforts to help that broken society pursue a lasting peace that’s why we built a global coalition with sanctions and principled diplomacy to prevent a nucleararmed iran and as we speak iran has rolled back its nuclear program shipped out its uranium stockpile and the world has avoided another war applause that’s how we stopped the spread of ebola in west africa applause our military our doctors our development workers  they were heroic they set up the platform that then allowed other countries to join in behind us and stamp out that epidemic hundreds of thousands maybe a couple million lives were saved that’s how we forged a transpacific partnership to open markets and protect workers and the environment and advance american leadership in asia it cuts  taxes on products made in america which will then support more good jobs here in america with tpp china does not set the rules in that region we do you want to show our strength in this new century approve this agreement give us the tools to enforce it its the right thing to do applause let me give you another example fifty years of isolating cuba had failed to promote democracy and set us back in latin america that’s why we\\xa0restored diplomatic relations\\xa0 applause  opened the door to travel and commerce positioned ourselves to improve the lives of the cuban people applause so if you want to consolidate our leadership and credibility in the hemisphere recognize that the cold war is over  lift the embargo applause the point is american leadership in the  century is not a choice between ignoring the rest of the world  except when we kill terrorists  or occupying and rebuilding whatever society is unraveling leadership means a wise application of military power and rallying the world behind causes that are right it means seeing our foreign assistance as a part of our national security not something separate not charity when we lead nearly  nations to the most ambitious agreement in history to fight climate change yes that helps vulnerable countries but it also protects our kids when we help ukraine defend its democracy or colombia resolve a decadeslong war that strengthens the international order we depend on when we help african countries feed their people and care for the sick  applause  its the right thing to do and it prevents the next pandemic from reaching our shores right now we’re on track to end the scourge of hivaids thats within our grasp applause and we have the chance to accomplish the same thing with malaria  something i’ll be pushing this congress to fund this year applause thats american strength thats american leadership and that kind of leadership depends on the power of our example\\xa0that’s why i will keep working to shut down the prison at guantanamo applause it is expensive it is unnecessary and it only serves as a recruitment brochure for our enemies applause there’s a better way applause and that’s why we need to reject any politics  any politics  that targets people because of race or religion applause let me just say this this is not a matter of political correctness this is a matter of understanding just what it is that makes us strong the world respects us not just for our arsenal it respects us for our diversity and our openness and the way we respect every faith his holiness pope francis told this body from the very spot that im standing on tonight that\\xa0“to imitate the hatred and violence of tyrants and murderers is the best way to take their place”\\xa0when politicians insult muslims whether abroad or our fellow citizens when a mosque is vandalized or a kid is called names that doesn’t make us safer that’s not telling it like it is it’s just wrong applause\\xa0it diminishes us in the eyes of the world it makes it harder to achieve our goals\\xa0it betrays who we are as a country applause “we the people” our constitution begins with those three simple words words we’ve come to recognize mean all the people not just some words that insist we rise and fall together and thats how we might perfect our union and that brings me to the fourth and maybe the most important thing that i want to say tonight the future we want  all of us want  opportunity and security for our families a rising standard of living a sustainable peaceful planet for our kids  all that is within our reach but it will only happen if we work together it will only happen if we can have rational constructive debates it will only happen if we fix our politics a better politics doesn’t mean we have to agree on everything this is a big country  different regions different attitudes different interests that’s one of our strengths too our founders distributed power between states and branches of government and expected us to argue just as they did fiercely over the size and shape of government over commerce and foreign relations over the meaning of liberty and the imperatives of security but democracy does require basic bonds of trust between its citizens it doesn’t work if we think the people who disagree with us are all motivated by malice it doesn’t work if we think that our political opponents are unpatriotic or trying to weaken america democracy grinds to a halt without a willingness to compromise or when even basic facts are contested or when we listen only to those who agree with us our public life withers when only the most extreme voices get all the attention and most of all democracy breaks down when the average person feels their voice doesn’t matter that the system is rigged in favor of the rich or the powerful or some special interest too many americans feel that way right now it’s one of the few regrets of my presidency  that the rancor and suspicion between the parties has gotten worse instead of better i have no doubt a president with the gifts of lincoln or roosevelt might have better bridged the divide and i guarantee i’ll keep trying to be better so long as i hold this office but my fellow americans this cannot be my task  or any president’s  alone there are a whole lot of folks in this chamber good people who would like to see more cooperation would like to see a more elevated debate in washington but feel trapped by the imperatives of getting elected by the noise coming out of your base i know you’ve told me its the worstkept secret in washington and a lot of you arent enjoying being trapped in that kind of rancor but that means if we want a better politics  and im addressing the american people now \\xa0if we want a better politics it’s not enough just to change a congressman or change a senator or even change a president we have to change the system to reflect our better selves\\xa0i think weve got to end the practice of drawing our congressional districts so that politicians can pick their voters and not the other way around applause let a bipartisan group do it applause we have to reduce the influence of money in our politics so that a handful of families or hidden interests can’t bankroll our elections applause and if our existing approach to campaign finance reform can’t pass muster in the courts we need to work together to find a real solution  because its a problem and most of you dont like raising money i know ive done it applause\\xa0we’ve got to make it easier to vote not harder applause we need to modernize it for the way we live now\\xa0applause this is america we want to make it easier for people to\\xa0participate and over the course of this year\\xa0i intend to travel the country to push for reforms that do just that but i can’t do these things on my own applause changes in our political process  in not just who gets elected but how they get elected  that will only happen when the american people demand it it depends on you that’s what’s meant by a government of by and for the people what i’m suggesting is hard it’s a lot easier to be cynical to accept that change is not possible and politics is hopeless and the problem is all the folks who are elected dont care and to believe that our voices and actions don’t matter but if we give up now then we forsake a better future those with money and power will gain greater control over the decisions that could send a young soldier to war or allow another economic disaster or roll back the equal rights and voting rights that generations of americans have fought even died to secure and then as frustration grows there will be voices urging us to fall back into our respective tribes to scapegoat fellow citizens who don’t look like us or pray like us or vote like we do or share the same background we can’t afford to go down that path it won’t deliver the economy we want it will not produce the security we want but most of all it contradicts everything that makes us the envy of the world so my fellow americans whatever you may believe whether you prefer one party or no party whether you supported my agenda or fought as hard as you could against it  our collective futures depends on your willingness to uphold your duties as a citizen to vote to speak out to stand up for others especially the weak especially the vulnerable knowing that each of us is only here because somebody somewhere stood up for us applause we need every american to stay active in our public life  and not just during election time  so that our public life reflects the goodness and the decency that i see in the american people every single day it is not easy our brand of democracy is hard but i can promise that a little over a year from now when i no longer hold this office i will be right there with you as a citizen inspired by those voices of fairness and vision of grit and good humor and kindness that helped america travel so far voices that help us see ourselves not first and foremost as black or white or asian or latino not as gay or straight immigrant or native born not as democrat or republican but as americans first bound by a common creed voices dr king believed would have the final word \\xa0voices of unarmed truth and unconditional love and they’re out there those voices they don’t get a lot of attention they dont seek a lot of fanfare but they’re busy doing the work this country needs doing i see them everywhere i travel in this incredible country of ours i see you the american people and in your daily acts of citizenship i see our future unfolding i\\xa0see it in the worker on the assembly line who clocked extra shifts to keep his company open and the boss who pays him higher wages instead of laying him off i see it in the dreamer who stays up late to finish her science project and the teacher who comes in early because he knows she might someday cure a disease i see it in the american who served his time and made mistakes as a child but now is dreaming of starting over  and i see it in the business owner who gives him that second chance the protester determined to prove that justice matters  and the young cop walking the beat treating everybody with respect doing the brave quiet work of keeping us safe applause i see it in the soldier who gives almost everything to save his brothers the nurse who tends to him till he can run a marathon the community that lines up to cheer him on it’s the son who finds the courage to come out as who he is and the father whose love for that son overrides everything he’s been taught\\xa0applause i see it in the elderly woman who will wait in line to cast her vote as long as she has to the new citizen who casts his vote for the first time the volunteers at the polls who believe every vote should count  because each of them in different ways know how much that precious right is worth thats the america i know that’s the country we love\\xa0cleareyed bighearted undaunted by challenge\\xa0optimistic that unarmed truth and unconditional love will have the final word applause that’s what makes me so hopeful about our future\\xa0i believe in change because i believe in you the american people and that’s why i stand here confident as i have ever been\\xa0that the state of our union is strong applause thank you god bless you god bless the united states of america'"

       "'mr speaker mr vice president members of congress my fellow americans tonight marks the eighth year that ive come here to report on the state of the union\\xa0and for this final one im going to try to make it a little shorter  i know some of you are antsy to get back to iowa laughter ive been there ill be shaking hands afterwards if you want some tips laughter and i understand that because its an election season expectations for what we will achieve this year are low\\xa0but mr speaker i appreciate the constructive approach that you and the other leaderstook at the end of last year to\\xa0pass a budget\\xa0and\\xa0make\\xa0tax cuts permanent\\xa0for working families so i hope we can work together this year on some bipartisan priorities like\\xa0criminal justice reform\\xa0   and helping people who are battling prescription drug abuse and heroin abuse  so who knows we might surprise the cynics again but tonight i want to go easy on the traditional list of proposals for the year ahead dont worry ive got plenty from\\xa0helping students learn to write computer code\\xa0to\\xa0personalizing medical treatments for patients and i will keep pushing for progress on the work that i believe still needs to be done\\xa0fixing a broken immigration system \\xa0protecting our kids from gun violence equal pay for equal work \\xa0paid leave raising the minimum wage  all these things still matter to hardworking families theyre still the right thing to do and i wont let up until they get done but for my final address to this chamber i dont want to just talk about next year i want to focus on the next five years the next  years and beyond\\xa0i want to focus on our future we live in a time of extraordinary change  change thats reshaping the way we live the way we work our planet our place in the world its change that promises amazing medical breakthroughs but also economic disruptions that strain working families it\\xa0promises education for girls in the most remote villages\\xa0but also connects terrorists plotting an ocean away its change that can broaden opportunity or widen inequality and whether we like it or not the pace of this change will only accelerate \\xa0america has been through big changes before  wars and depression the\\xa0influx of new immigrants workers fighting for a fair deal movements to expand civil rights\\xa0each time there have been those who told us to fear the future who claimed we could slam the brakes on change who promised to restore past glory if we just got some group or idea that was threatening america under control and each time we overcame those fears\\xa0we did not in the words of lincoln adhere to the dogmas of the quiet past instead we thought anew and acted anew\\xa0we made change work for us always extending americas promise outward to the next frontier to more people and because we did  because we saw opportunity where others saw only peril  we emerged stronger and better than before what was true then can be true now our unique strengths as a nation  our optimism and work ethic our spirit of discovery our diversity our commitment to rule of law  these things give us everything we need to ensure prosperity and security for generations to come in fact its that spirit that made the progress of these past seven years possible\\xa0 its how we recovered from the worst economic crisis in generations\\xa0 its how we reformed our health care system and reinvented our energy sector how we delivered more care and benefits to our troops and veterans and\\xa0how we secured the freedom in every state to marry the person we love but such progress is not inevitable its the result of choices we make together and we face such choices right now will we respond to the changes of our time with fear turning inward as a nation turning against each other as a people or will we face the future with confidence in who we are in what we stand for in the incredible things that we can do together so lets talk about the future and four big questions that i believe we as a country have to answer  regardless of who the next president is or who controls the next congress first how do we give everyone a fair shot at opportunity and security in this new economy\\xa0 second how do we make technology work for us and not against us  especially when it comes to solving urgent challenges like climate change\\xa0 third how do we keep america safe and lead the world without becoming its policeman\\xa0 and finally how can we make our politics reflect whats best in us and not whats worst let me start with the economy and a basic fact\\xa0the united states of america right now\\xa0has the strongest most durable economy in the world\\xa0\\xa0were in the middle of the longest streak of private sector job creation in history\\xa0\\xa0more than  million new jobs the strongest two years of job growth since the  an unemployment rate cut in half\\xa0our auto industry just had its best year ever  thats just part of a manufacturing surge thats created nearly  new jobs in the past six years and weve done all this while cutting our deficits by almost threequarters\\xa0 anyone claiming that americas economy is in decline is peddling fiction  now what is true  and the reason that a lot of americans feel anxious\\xa0 is that the economy has been changing in profound ways changes that started long\\xa0before the\\xa0great recession hit changes that have not let up today technology doesnt just replace jobs on the assembly line but any job where work can be automated\\xa0companies in a global economy can locate anywhere and they face tougher competition as a result workers have less leverage for a raise\\xa0companies have less loyalty to their communities and more and more wealth and income is concentrated at the very top all these trends have squeezed workers even when they have jobs even when the economy is growing its made it harder for a hardworking family to pull itself out of poverty harder for young people to start their careers tougher for workers to retire when they want to and although none of these trends are unique to america they do offend our uniquely american belief that everybody who works hard should get a fair shot for the past seven years our goal has been a growing economy that works also better for everybody weve made progress but we need to make more and despite all the political arguments that weve had these past few years there are actually some areas where americans broadly agree we agree that real opportunity requires every american to get the education and training they need to land a goodpaying job\\xa0the bipartisan reform of no child left behind was an important start and together weve increased early childhood education\\xa0lifted high school graduation rates to new highs\\xa0boosted graduates in fields like engineering in the coming years we should build on that progress by providing prek for all and    offering every student the handson computer science and math classes that make them jobready on day one we should recruit and support more great teachers for our kids  and we have to make college affordable for every american  no hardworking student should be\\xa0stuck in the redweve already reduced student loan payments to  percent of a borrowers income and thats good but now weve actually got to cut the cost of college\\xa0\\xa0providing two years of community college at no cost for every responsible student is one of the best ways to do that and im going to keep fighting to get that started this year  its the right thing to do  but a great education isnt all we need in this new economy we also need benefits and protections that provide a basic measure of security its not too much of a stretch to say that some of the only people in america who are going to work the same job in the same place with a health and retirement package for  years are sitting in this chamber laughter for everyone else especially folks in their  and  saving for retirement or bouncing back from job loss has gotten a lot tougher americans understand that at some point in their careers in this new economy they may have to retool and they may have to retrain but they shouldnt lose what theyve already worked so hard to build in the process thats why social security and medicare are more important than ever we shouldnt weaken them we should strengthen them and for americans short of retirement basic benefits should be just as mobile as everything else is today\\xa0that by the way is what the affordable care act is all about\\xa0its about filling the gaps in employerbased care so that when you lose a job or you go back to school or you strike out and launch that new business youll still have coverage nearly  million people have gained coverage so far  and in the process health care inflation has slowedand our businesses have created jobs every single month since it became law now im guessing we wont agree on health care anytime soon  a little  right there laughter just a guess but there should be other ways parties can work together to improve economic security say a hardworking american loses his job  we shouldnt just make sure that he can get unemployment insurance we should make sure that program encourages him to retrain for a business thats ready to hire him if that new job doesnt pay as much there should be a system of wage insurance in place so that he can still pay his bills and even if hes going from job to job he should still be able to save for retirement and take his savings with him thats the way we make the new economy work better for everybody i also know speaker ryan has talked about his interest in tackling poverty america is about giving everybody willing to work a chance a hand up\\xa0and id welcome a serious discussion about strategies we can all support like expanding tax cuts for lowincome workers who dont have children\\xa0 but there are some areas where we just have to be honest  it has been difficult to find agreement over the last seven years and a lot of them fall under the category of what role the government should play in making sure the systems not rigged in favor of the wealthiest and biggest corporations  and its an honest disagreement and the american people have a choice to make i believe a thriving private sector is the lifeblood of our economy i think there are outdated regulations that need to be changed there is red tape that needs to be cut  there you go yes  but after years now of record corporate profits working families wont get more opportunity or bigger paychecks just by letting big banks or big oil or hedge funds make their own rules at everybody elses expense  middleclass families are not going to feel more secure because we allowed attacks on collective bargaining to go unanswered food stamp recipients did not cause the financial crisis recklessness on wall street did  immigrants arent the principal reason wages havent gone up those decisions are made in the boardrooms that all too often put quarterly earnings over longterm returns its sure not the average family watching tonight that avoids paying taxes through offshore accounts  the point is i believe that in this new economy workers and startups and small businesses need more of a voice not less the rules should work for them  and im not alone in this this year i plan to lift up the many businesses whove figured out that doing right by their workers or their customers or their communities ends up being good for their shareholders  and i want to spread those best practices across america thats part of a brighter future  in fact it turns out many of our best corporate citizens are also our most creative and this brings me to the second big question we as a country have to answer how do we reignite that spirit of innovation to meet our biggest challenges sixty years ago when the russians beat us into space we didnt deny sputnik was up there laughter we didnt argue about the science or shrink our research and development budget\\xa0we built a space program almost overnight and  years later we were walking on the moon\\xa0 now that spirit of discovery is in our dna america is thomas edison and the wright brothers\\xa0and george washington carver america is grace hopper and katherine johnson and sally ride america is every immigrant and entrepreneur from boston to austin to silicon valley racing to shape a better world  thats who we are and over the past seven years weve nurtured that spirit\\xa0weve protected an open internet and taken bold new steps to get more students and lowincome americans online  weve launched nextgeneration manufacturing hubs and online tools that give an entrepreneur everything he or she needs to start a business in a single day but we can do so much more last year vice president biden said that with a new moonshotamerica can cure cancer\\xa0last month he worked with this congress to give scientists at the national institutes of health the strongest resources that theyve had in over a decade  so tonight im announcing a new national effort to get it done and because hes gone to the mat for all of us on so many issues over the past  years\\xa0im putting joe in charge of mission control \\xa0for the loved ones weve all lost for the families that we can still save lets make america the country that cures cancer once and for all medical research is critical we need the same level of commitment when it comes to developing clean energy sources look if anybody still wants to dispute the science around climate change have at it you will be pretty lonely because youll be debating our military most of americas business leaders the majority of the american people almost the entire scientific community and  nations around the world who agree its a problem and intend to solve it\\xa0 but even if  even if the planet wasnt at stake even if  wasnt the warmest year on record  until  turned out to be even hotter  why would we want to pass up the chance for american businesses to produce and sell the energy of the future  listen seven years ago we made the single biggest investment in clean energy in our history here are the results in fields from iowa to texas wind power is now cheaper than dirtier conventional power on rooftops from arizona to new york solar is saving americans tens of millions of dollars a year on their energy bills and employs more americans than coal  in jobs that pay better than average were taking steps to give homeowners the freedom to generate and store their own energy  something by the way that environmentalists and tea partiers have teamed up to support and meanwhile weve cut our imports of foreign oil by nearly  percent and cut carbon pollution more than any other country on earth  gas under two bucks a gallon aint bad either\\xa0 now weve got to accelerate the transition away from old dirtier energy sources rather than subsidize the past we should invest in the future  especially in communities that rely on fossil fuels we do them no favor when we dont show them where the trends are going thats why im going to push to change the way we manage our oil and coal resources so that they better reflect the costs they impose on taxpayers and our planet and that way we put money back into those communities and put tens of thousands of americans to work building a  century transportation system  now none of this is going to happen overnight and yes there are plenty of entrenched interests who want to protect the status quo but the jobs well create the money well save the planet well preserve  that is the kind of future our kids and our grandkids deserve and its within our grasp climate change is just one of many issues where our security is linked to the rest of the world\\xa0and thats why the third big question that we have to answer together is how to keep america safe and strong without either isolating ourselves or trying to nationbuild everywhere theres a problem i told you earlier all the talk of americas economic decline is political hot air well so is all the rhetoric you hear about our enemies getting stronger and america getting weaker let me tell you something the united states of america is the most powerful nation on earth period  period its not even close its not even close  its not even close we spend more on our military than the next eight nations combined our troops are the finest fighting force in the history of the world  no nation attacks us directly or our allies because they know thats the path to ruin\\xa0surveys show our standing around the world is higher than when i was elected to this office and when it comes to every important international issue people of the world do not look to beijing or moscow to lead  they call us\\xa0 i mean its useful to level the set here because when we dont we dont make good decisions now as someone who begins every day with\\xa0an intelligence briefing i know this is a dangerous time but thats not primarily because of some looming superpower out there and certainly not because of diminished american strength in todays world were threatened less by evil empires and more by failing states the middle east is going through a transformation that will play out for a generation rooted in conflicts that date back millennia economic headwinds are blowing in from a chinese economy that is in significant transition even as their economy severely contracts russia is pouring resources in to prop up ukraine and syria  client states that they saw slipping away from their orbit\\xa0and the international system we built after world war ii is now struggling to keep pace with this new reality its up to us the united states of america to help remake that system\\xa0and to do that well it means that weve got to set priorities priority number one is protecting the american people and going after terrorist networks  both al qaeda and now isil pose a direct threat to our people because in todays world even a handful of terrorists who place no value on human life including their own can do a lot of damage they use the internet to poison the minds of individuals inside our country\\xa0their actions undermine and destabilize our allies\\xa0we have to take them outp but as we focus on destroying isil overthetop claims that this is world war iii just play into their hands masses of fighters on the back of pickup trucks twisted souls plotting in apartments or garages  they pose an enormous danger to civilians they have to be stopped but they do not threaten our national existence  that is the story isil wants to tell thats the kind of propaganda they use to recruit we dont need to build them up to show that were serious and we sure dont need to push away vital allies in this fight by echoing the lie that isil is somehow representative of one of the worlds largest religions  we just need to call them what they are  killers and fanatics who have to be rooted out hunted down and destroyed  and thats exactly what were doing\\xa0for more than a year america has led a coalition of more than  countries to cut off isils financing disrupt their plots\\xa0stop the flow of terrorist fighters and stamp out their vicious ideology with nearly  air strikes were taking out their leadership their oil their training camps their weapons\\xa0were training arming and supporting forces who are steadily reclaiming territory in iraq and syria if this congress is serious about winning this war and wants to send a message to our troops and the world authorize the use of military force against isil take a vote  take a vote but the american people should know that with or without\\xa0congressional action isil will learn the same lessons as terrorists before them\\xa0if you doubt americas commitment  or mine  to see that justice is done just ask osama bin laden\\xa0 ask the leader of al qaeda in yemen who was taken out last year or the perpetrator of the benghazi attacks who sits in a prison cell when you come after americans we go after you  and it may take time but we have long memories and our reach has no limits  our foreign policy hast to be focused on the threat from isil and al qaeda but it cant stop there for even without isil even without al qaeda instability will continue for decades in many parts of the world  in the middle east in afghanistan parts of pakistan in parts of central america in africa and asia some of these places may become safe havens for new terrorist networks others will just fall victim to ethnic conflict or famine feeding the next wave of refugees the world will look to us to help solve these problems and our answer needs to be more than tough talk or calls to carpetbomb civilians that may work as a tv sound bite but it doesnt pass muster on the world stage we also cant try to take over and rebuild every country that falls into crisis even if its done with the best of intentions  thats not leadership thats a recipe for quagmire spilling american blood and treasure that ultimately will weaken us its the lesson of vietnam its the lesson of iraq  and we should have learned it by now  fortunately there is a smarter approach a patient and disciplined strategy that uses every element of our national power it says america will always act alone if necessary to protect our people and our allies but on issues of global concern we will mobilize the world to work with us and make sure other countries pull their own weight thats our approach to conflicts like syria where were partnering with local forces and leading international efforts to help that broken society pursue a lasting peace thats why we built a global coalition with sanctions and principled diplomacy to prevent a nucleararmed iran and as we speak iran has rolled back its nuclear program shipped out its uranium stockpile and the world has avoided another war  thats how we stopped the spread of ebola in west africa  our military our doctors our development workers  they were heroic they set up the platform that then allowed other countries to join in behind us and stamp out that epidemic hundreds of thousands maybe a couple million lives were saved thats how we forged a transpacific partnership to open markets and protect workers and the environment and advance american leadership in asia it cuts  taxes on products made in america which will then support more good jobs here in america with tpp china does not set the rules in that region we do you want to show our strength in this new century approve this agreement give us the tools to enforce it its the right thing to do  let me give you another example fifty years of isolating cuba had failed to promote democracy and set us back in latin america thats why we\\xa0restored diplomatic relations\\xa0   opened the door to travel and commerce positioned ourselves to improve the lives of the cuban people  so if you want to consolidate our leadership and credibility in the hemisphere recognize that the cold war is over  lift the embargo  the point is american leadership in the  century is not a choice between ignoring the rest of the world  except when we kill terrorists  or occupying and rebuilding whatever society is unraveling leadership means a wise application of military power and rallying the world behind causes that are right it means seeing our foreign assistance as a part of our national security not something separate not charity when we lead nearly  nations to the most ambitious agreement in history to fight climate change yes that helps vulnerable countries but it also protects our kids when we help ukraine defend its democracy or colombia resolve a decadeslong war that strengthens the international order we depend on when we help african countries feed their people and care for the sick    its the right thing to do and it prevents the next pandemic from reaching our shores right now were on track to end the scourge of hivaids thats within our grasp  and we have the chance to accomplish the same thing with malaria  something ill be pushing this congress to fund this year  thats american strength thats american leadership and that kind of leadership depends on the power of our example\\xa0thats why i will keep working to shut down the prison at guantanamo  it is expensive it is unnecessary and it only serves as a recruitment brochure for our enemies  theres a better way  and thats why we need to reject any politics  any politics  that targets people because of race or religion  let me just say this this is not a matter of political correctness this is a matter of understanding just what it is that makes us strong the world respects us not just for our arsenal it respects us for our diversity and our openness and the way we respect every faith his holiness pope francis told this body from the very spot that im standing on tonight that\\xa0to imitate the hatred and violence of tyrants and murderers is the best way to take their place\\xa0when politicians insult muslims whether abroad or our fellow citizens when a mosque is vandalized or a kid is called names that doesnt make us safer thats not telling it like it is its just wrong \\xa0it diminishes us in the eyes of the world it makes it harder to achieve our goals\\xa0it betrays who we are as a country  we the people our constitution begins with those three simple words words weve come to recognize mean all the people not just some words that insist we rise and fall together and thats how we might perfect our union and that brings me to the fourth and maybe the most important thing that i want to say tonight the future we want  all of us want  opportunity and security for our families a rising standard of living a sustainable peaceful planet for our kids  all that is within our reach but it will only happen if we work together it will only happen if we can have rational constructive debates it will only happen if we fix our politics a better politics doesnt mean we have to agree on everything this is a big country  different regions different attitudes different interests thats one of our strengths too our founders distributed power between states and branches of government and expected us to argue just as they did fiercely over the size and shape of government over commerce and foreign relations over the meaning of liberty and the imperatives of security but democracy does require basic bonds of trust between its citizens it doesnt work if we think the people who disagree with us are all motivated by malice it doesnt work if we think that our political opponents are unpatriotic or trying to weaken america democracy grinds to a halt without a willingness to compromise or when even basic facts are contested or when we listen only to those who agree with us our public life withers when only the most extreme voices get all the attention and most of all democracy breaks down when the average person feels their voice doesnt matter that the system is rigged in favor of the rich or the powerful or some special interest too many americans feel that way right now its one of the few regrets of my presidency  that the rancor and suspicion between the parties has gotten worse instead of better i have no doubt a president with the gifts of lincoln or roosevelt might have better bridged the divide and i guarantee ill keep trying to be better so long as i hold this office but my fellow americans this cannot be my task  or any presidents  alone there are a whole lot of folks in this chamber good people who would like to see more cooperation would like to see a more elevated debate in washington but feel trapped by the imperatives of getting elected by the noise coming out of your base i know youve told me its the worstkept secret in washington and a lot of you arent enjoying being trapped in that kind of rancor but that means if we want a better politics  and im addressing the american people now \\xa0if we want a better politics its not enough just to change a congressman or change a senator or even change a president we have to change the system to reflect our better selves\\xa0i think weve got to end the practice of drawing our congressional districts so that politicians can pick their voters and not the other way around  let a bipartisan group do it  we have to reduce the influence of money in our politics so that a handful of families or hidden interests cant bankroll our elections  and if our existing approach to campaign finance reform cant pass muster in the courts we need to work together to find a real solution  because its a problem and most of you dont like raising money i know ive done it \\xa0weve got to make it easier to vote not harder  we need to modernize it for the way we live now\\xa0 this is america we want to make it easier for people to\\xa0participate and over the course of this year\\xa0i intend to travel the country to push for reforms that do just that but i cant do these things on my own  changes in our political process  in not just who gets elected but how they get elected  that will only happen when the american people demand it it depends on you thats whats meant by a government of by and for the people what im suggesting is hard its a lot easier to be cynical to accept that change is not possible and politics is hopeless and the problem is all the folks who are elected dont care and to believe that our voices and actions dont matter but if we give up now then we forsake a better future those with money and power will gain greater control over the decisions that could send a young soldier to war or allow another economic disaster or roll back the equal rights and voting rights that generations of americans have fought even died to secure and then as frustration grows there will be voices urging us to fall back into our respective tribes to scapegoat fellow citizens who dont look like us or pray like us or vote like we do or share the same background we cant afford to go down that path it wont deliver the economy we want it will not produce the security we want but most of all it contradicts everything that makes us the envy of the world so my fellow americans whatever you may believe whether you prefer one party or no party whether you supported my agenda or fought as hard as you could against it  our collective futures depends on your willingness to uphold your duties as a citizen to vote to speak out to stand up for others especially the weak especially the vulnerable knowing that each of us is only here because somebody somewhere stood up for us  we need every american to stay active in our public life  and not just during election time  so that our public life reflects the goodness and the decency that i see in the american people every single day it is not easy our brand of democracy is hard but i can promise that a little over a year from now when i no longer hold this office i will be right there with you as a citizen inspired by those voices of fairness and vision of grit and good humor and kindness that helped america travel so far voices that help us see ourselves not first and foremost as black or white or asian or latino not as gay or straight immigrant or native born not as democrat or republican but as americans first bound by a common creed voices dr king believed would have the final word \\xa0voices of unarmed truth and unconditional love and theyre out there those voices they dont get a lot of attention they dont seek a lot of fanfare but theyre busy doing the work this country needs doing i see them everywhere i travel in this incredible country of ours i see you the american people and in your daily acts of citizenship i see our future unfolding i\\xa0see it in the worker on the assembly line who clocked extra shifts to keep his company open and the boss who pays him higher wages instead of laying him off i see it in the dreamer who stays up late to finish her science project and the teacher who comes in early because he knows she might someday cure a disease i see it in the american who served his time and made mistakes as a child but now is dreaming of starting over  and i see it in the business owner who gives him that second chance the protester determined to prove that justice matters  and the young cop walking the beat treating everybody with respect doing the brave quiet work of keeping us safe  i see it in the soldier who gives almost everything to save his brothers the nurse who tends to him till he can run a marathon the community that lines up to cheer him on its the son who finds the courage to come out as who he is and the father whose love for that son overrides everything hes been taught\\xa0 i see it in the elderly woman who will wait in line to cast her vote as long as she has to the new citizen who casts his vote for the first time the volunteers at the polls who believe every vote should count  because each of them in different ways know how much that precious right is worth thats the america i know thats the country we love\\xa0cleareyed bighearted undaunted by challenge\\xa0optimistic that unarmed truth and unconditional love will have the final word  thats what makes me so hopeful about our future\\xa0i believe in change because i believe in you the american people and thats why i stand here confident as i have ever been\\xa0that the state of our union is strong  thank you god bless you god bless the united states of america'"

       "'mr speaker mr vice president members of congress my fellow americans tonight marks the eighth year that ive come here to report on the state of the union and for this final one im going to try to make it a little shorter  i know some of you are antsy to get back to iowa laughter ive been there ill be shaking hands afterwards if you want some tips laughter and i understand that because its an election season expectations for what we will achieve this year are low but mr speaker i appreciate the constructive approach that you and the other leaderstook at the end of last year to pass a budget and make tax cuts permanent for working families so i hope we can work together this year on some bipartisan priorities like criminal justice reform    and helping people who are battling prescription drug abuse and heroin abuse  so who knows we might surprise the cynics again but tonight i want to go easy on the traditional list of proposals for the year ahead dont worry ive got plenty from helping students learn to write computer code to personalizing medical treatments for patients and i will keep pushing for progress on the work that i believe still needs to be done fixing a broken immigration system  protecting our kids from gun violence equal pay for equal work  paid leave raising the minimum wage  all these things still matter to hardworking families theyre still the right thing to do and i wont let up until they get done but for my final address to this chamber i dont want to just talk about next year i want to focus on the next five years the next  years and beyond i want to focus on our future we live in a time of extraordinary change  change thats reshaping the way we live the way we work our planet our place in the world its change that promises amazing medical breakthroughs but also economic disruptions that strain working families it promises education for girls in the most remote villages but also connects terrorists plotting an ocean away its change that can broaden opportunity or widen inequality and whether we like it or not the pace of this change will only accelerate  america has been through big changes before  wars and depression the influx of new immigrants workers fighting for a fair deal movements to expand civil rights each time there have been those who told us to fear the future who claimed we could slam the brakes on change who promised to restore past glory if we just got some group or idea that was threatening america under control and each time we overcame those fears we did not in the words of lincoln adhere to the dogmas of the quiet past instead we thought anew and acted anew we made change work for us always extending americas promise outward to the next frontier to more people and because we did  because we saw opportunity where others saw only peril  we emerged stronger and better than before what was true then can be true now our unique strengths as a nation  our optimism and work ethic our spirit of discovery our diversity our commitment to rule of law  these things give us everything we need to ensure prosperity and security for generations to come in fact its that spirit that made the progress of these past seven years possible  its how we recovered from the worst economic crisis in generations  its how we reformed our health care system and reinvented our energy sector how we delivered more care and benefits to our troops and veterans and how we secured the freedom in every state to marry the person we love but such progress is not inevitable its the result of choices we make together and we face such choices right now will we respond to the changes of our time with fear turning inward as a nation turning against each other as a people or will we face the future with confidence in who we are in what we stand for in the incredible things that we can do together so lets talk about the future and four big questions that i believe we as a country have to answer  regardless of who the next president is or who controls the next congress first how do we give everyone a fair shot at opportunity and security in this new economy  second how do we make technology work for us and not against us  especially when it comes to solving urgent challenges like climate change  third how do we keep america safe and lead the world without becoming its policeman  and finally how can we make our politics reflect whats best in us and not whats worst let me start with the economy and a basic fact the united states of america right now has the strongest most durable economy in the world were in the middle of the longest streak of private sector job creation in history more than  million new jobs the strongest two years of job growth since the  an unemployment rate cut in half our auto industry just had its best year ever  thats just part of a manufacturing surge thats created nearly  new jobs in the past six years and weve done all this while cutting our deficits by almost threequarters  anyone claiming that americas economy is in decline is peddling fiction  now what is true  and the reason that a lot of americans feel anxious  is that the economy has been changing in profound ways changes that started long before the great recession hit changes that have not let up today technology doesnt just replace jobs on the assembly line but any job where work can be automated companies in a global economy can locate anywhere and they face tougher competition as a result workers have less leverage for a raise companies have less loyalty to their communities and more and more wealth and income is concentrated at the very top all these trends have squeezed workers even when they have jobs even when the economy is growing its made it harder for a hardworking family to pull itself out of poverty harder for young people to start their careers tougher for workers to retire when they want to and although none of these trends are unique to america they do offend our uniquely american belief that everybody who works hard should get a fair shot for the past seven years our goal has been a growing economy that works also better for everybody weve made progress but we need to make more and despite all the political arguments that weve had these past few years there are actually some areas where americans broadly agree we agree that real opportunity requires every american to get the education and training they need to land a goodpaying job the bipartisan reform of no child left behind was an important start and together weve increased early childhood education lifted high school graduation rates to new highs boosted graduates in fields like engineering in the coming years we should build on that progress by providing prek for all and    offering every student the handson computer science and math classes that make them jobready on day one we should recruit and support more great teachers for our kids  and we have to make college affordable for every american  no hardworking student should be stuck in the redweve already reduced student loan payments to  percent of a borrowers income and thats good but now weve actually got to cut the cost of college providing two years of community college at no cost for every responsible student is one of the best ways to do that and im going to keep fighting to get that started this year  its the right thing to do  but a great education isnt all we need in this new economy we also need benefits and protections that provide a basic measure of security its not too much of a stretch to say that some of the only people in america who are going to work the same job in the same place with a health and retirement package for  years are sitting in this chamber laughter for everyone else especially folks in their  and  saving for retirement or bouncing back from job loss has gotten a lot tougher americans understand that at some point in their careers in this new economy they may have to retool and they may have to retrain but they shouldnt lose what theyve already worked so hard to build in the process thats why social security and medicare are more important than ever we shouldnt weaken them we should strengthen them and for americans short of retirement basic benefits should be just as mobile as everything else is today that by the way is what the affordable care act is all about its about filling the gaps in employerbased care so that when you lose a job or you go back to school or you strike out and launch that new business youll still have coverage nearly  million people have gained coverage so far  and in the process health care inflation has slowedand our businesses have created jobs every single month since it became law now im guessing we wont agree on health care anytime soon  a little  right there laughter just a guess but there should be other ways parties can work together to improve economic security say a hardworking american loses his job  we shouldnt just make sure that he can get unemployment insurance we should make sure that program encourages him to retrain for a business thats ready to hire him if that new job doesnt pay as much there should be a system of wage insurance in place so that he can still pay his bills and even if hes going from job to job he should still be able to save for retirement and take his savings with him thats the way we make the new economy work better for everybody i also know speaker ryan has talked about his interest in tackling poverty america is about giving everybody willing to work a chance a hand up and id welcome a serious discussion about strategies we can all support like expanding tax cuts for lowincome workers who dont have children  but there are some areas where we just have to be honest  it has been difficult to find agreement over the last seven years and a lot of them fall under the category of what role the government should play in making sure the systems not rigged in favor of the wealthiest and biggest corporations  and its an honest disagreement and the american people have a choice to make i believe a thriving private sector is the lifeblood of our economy i think there are outdated regulations that need to be changed there is red tape that needs to be cut  there you go yes  but after years now of record corporate profits working families wont get more opportunity or bigger paychecks just by letting big banks or big oil or hedge funds make their own rules at everybody elses expense  middleclass families are not going to feel more secure because we allowed attacks on collective bargaining to go unanswered food stamp recipients did not cause the financial crisis recklessness on wall street did  immigrants arent the principal reason wages havent gone up those decisions are made in the boardrooms that all too often put quarterly earnings over longterm returns its sure not the average family watching tonight that avoids paying taxes through offshore accounts  the point is i believe that in this new economy workers and startups and small businesses need more of a voice not less the rules should work for them  and im not alone in this this year i plan to lift up the many businesses whove figured out that doing right by their workers or their customers or their communities ends up being good for their shareholders  and i want to spread those best practices across america thats part of a brighter future  in fact it turns out many of our best corporate citizens are also our most creative and this brings me to the second big question we as a country have to answer how do we reignite that spirit of innovation to meet our biggest challenges sixty years ago when the russians beat us into space we didnt deny sputnik was up there laughter we didnt argue about the science or shrink our research and development budget we built a space program almost overnight and  years later we were walking on the moon  now that spirit of discovery is in our dna america is thomas edison and the wright brothers and george washington carver america is grace hopper and katherine johnson and sally ride america is every immigrant and entrepreneur from boston to austin to silicon valley racing to shape a better world  thats who we are and over the past seven years weve nurtured that spirit weve protected an open internet and taken bold new steps to get more students and lowincome americans online  weve launched nextgeneration manufacturing hubs and online tools that give an entrepreneur everything he or she needs to start a business in a single day but we can do so much more last year vice president biden said that with a new moonshotamerica can cure cancer last month he worked with this congress to give scientists at the national institutes of health the strongest resources that theyve had in over a decade  so tonight im announcing a new national effort to get it done and because hes gone to the mat for all of us on so many issues over the past  years im putting joe in charge of mission control  for the loved ones weve all lost for the families that we can still save lets make america the country that cures cancer once and for all medical research is critical we need the same level of commitment when it comes to developing clean energy sources look if anybody still wants to dispute the science around climate change have at it you will be pretty lonely because youll be debating our military most of americas business leaders the majority of the american people almost the entire scientific community and  nations around the world who agree its a problem and intend to solve it  but even if  even if the planet wasnt at stake even if  wasnt the warmest year on record  until  turned out to be even hotter  why would we want to pass up the chance for american businesses to produce and sell the energy of the future  listen seven years ago we made the single biggest investment in clean energy in our history here are the results in fields from iowa to texas wind power is now cheaper than dirtier conventional power on rooftops from arizona to new york solar is saving americans tens of millions of dollars a year on their energy bills and employs more americans than coal  in jobs that pay better than average were taking steps to give homeowners the freedom to generate and store their own energy  something by the way that environmentalists and tea partiers have teamed up to support and meanwhile weve cut our imports of foreign oil by nearly  percent and cut carbon pollution more than any other country on earth  gas under two bucks a gallon aint bad either  now weve got to accelerate the transition away from old dirtier energy sources rather than subsidize the past we should invest in the future  especially in communities that rely on fossil fuels we do them no favor when we dont show them where the trends are going thats why im going to push to change the way we manage our oil and coal resources so that they better reflect the costs they impose on taxpayers and our planet and that way we put money back into those communities and put tens of thousands of americans to work building a  century transportation system  now none of this is going to happen overnight and yes there are plenty of entrenched interests who want to protect the status quo but the jobs well create the money well save the planet well preserve  that is the kind of future our kids and our grandkids deserve and its within our grasp climate change is just one of many issues where our security is linked to the rest of the world and thats why the third big question that we have to answer together is how to keep america safe and strong without either isolating ourselves or trying to nationbuild everywhere theres a problem i told you earlier all the talk of americas economic decline is political hot air well so is all the rhetoric you hear about our enemies getting stronger and america getting weaker let me tell you something the united states of america is the most powerful nation on earth period  period its not even close its not even close  its not even close we spend more on our military than the next eight nations combined our troops are the finest fighting force in the history of the world  no nation attacks us directly or our allies because they know thats the path to ruin surveys show our standing around the world is higher than when i was elected to this office and when it comes to every important international issue people of the world do not look to beijing or moscow to lead  they call us  i mean its useful to level the set here because when we dont we dont make good decisions now as someone who begins every day with an intelligence briefing i know this is a dangerous time but thats not primarily because of some looming superpower out there and certainly not because of diminished american strength in todays world were threatened less by evil empires and more by failing states the middle east is going through a transformation that will play out for a generation rooted in conflicts that date back millennia economic headwinds are blowing in from a chinese economy that is in significant transition even as their economy severely contracts russia is pouring resources in to prop up ukraine and syria  client states that they saw slipping away from their orbit and the international system we built after world war ii is now struggling to keep pace with this new reality its up to us the united states of america to help remake that system and to do that well it means that weve got to set priorities priority number one is protecting the american people and going after terrorist networks  both al qaeda and now isil pose a direct threat to our people because in todays world even a handful of terrorists who place no value on human life including their own can do a lot of damage they use the internet to poison the minds of individuals inside our country their actions undermine and destabilize our allies we have to take them outp but as we focus on destroying isil overthetop claims that this is world war iii just play into their hands masses of fighters on the back of pickup trucks twisted souls plotting in apartments or garages  they pose an enormous danger to civilians they have to be stopped but they do not threaten our national existence  that is the story isil wants to tell thats the kind of propaganda they use to recruit we dont need to build them up to show that were serious and we sure dont need to push away vital allies in this fight by echoing the lie that isil is somehow representative of one of the worlds largest religions  we just need to call them what they are  killers and fanatics who have to be rooted out hunted down and destroyed  and thats exactly what were doing for more than a year america has led a coalition of more than  countries to cut off isils financing disrupt their plots stop the flow of terrorist fighters and stamp out their vicious ideology with nearly  air strikes were taking out their leadership their oil their training camps their weapons were training arming and supporting forces who are steadily reclaiming territory in iraq and syria if this congress is serious about winning this war and wants to send a message to our troops and the world authorize the use of military force against isil take a vote  take a vote but the american people should know that with or without congressional action isil will learn the same lessons as terrorists before them if you doubt americas commitment  or mine  to see that justice is done just ask osama bin laden  ask the leader of al qaeda in yemen who was taken out last year or the perpetrator of the benghazi attacks who sits in a prison cell when you come after americans we go after you  and it may take time but we have long memories and our reach has no limits  our foreign policy hast to be focused on the threat from isil and al qaeda but it cant stop there for even without isil even without al qaeda instability will continue for decades in many parts of the world  in the middle east in afghanistan parts of pakistan in parts of central america in africa and asia some of these places may become safe havens for new terrorist networks others will just fall victim to ethnic conflict or famine feeding the next wave of refugees the world will look to us to help solve these problems and our answer needs to be more than tough talk or calls to carpetbomb civilians that may work as a tv sound bite but it doesnt pass muster on the world stage we also cant try to take over and rebuild every country that falls into crisis even if its done with the best of intentions  thats not leadership thats a recipe for quagmire spilling american blood and treasure that ultimately will weaken us its the lesson of vietnam its the lesson of iraq  and we should have learned it by now  fortunately there is a smarter approach a patient and disciplined strategy that uses every element of our national power it says america will always act alone if necessary to protect our people and our allies but on issues of global concern we will mobilize the world to work with us and make sure other countries pull their own weight thats our approach to conflicts like syria where were partnering with local forces and leading international efforts to help that broken society pursue a lasting peace thats why we built a global coalition with sanctions and principled diplomacy to prevent a nucleararmed iran and as we speak iran has rolled back its nuclear program shipped out its uranium stockpile and the world has avoided another war  thats how we stopped the spread of ebola in west africa  our military our doctors our development workers  they were heroic they set up the platform that then allowed other countries to join in behind us and stamp out that epidemic hundreds of thousands maybe a couple million lives were saved thats how we forged a transpacific partnership to open markets and protect workers and the environment and advance american leadership in asia it cuts  taxes on products made in america which will then support more good jobs here in america with tpp china does not set the rules in that region we do you want to show our strength in this new century approve this agreement give us the tools to enforce it its the right thing to do  let me give you another example fifty years of isolating cuba had failed to promote democracy and set us back in latin america thats why we restored diplomatic relations    opened the door to travel and commerce positioned ourselves to improve the lives of the cuban people  so if you want to consolidate our leadership and credibility in the hemisphere recognize that the cold war is over  lift the embargo  the point is american leadership in the  century is not a choice between ignoring the rest of the world  except when we kill terrorists  or occupying and rebuilding whatever society is unraveling leadership means a wise application of military power and rallying the world behind causes that are right it means seeing our foreign assistance as a part of our national security not something separate not charity when we lead nearly  nations to the most ambitious agreement in history to fight climate change yes that helps vulnerable countries but it also protects our kids when we help ukraine defend its democracy or colombia resolve a decadeslong war that strengthens the international order we depend on when we help african countries feed their people and care for the sick    its the right thing to do and it prevents the next pandemic from reaching our shores right now were on track to end the scourge of hivaids thats within our grasp  and we have the chance to accomplish the same thing with malaria  something ill be pushing this congress to fund this year  thats american strength thats american leadership and that kind of leadership depends on the power of our example thats why i will keep working to shut down the prison at guantanamo  it is expensive it is unnecessary and it only serves as a recruitment brochure for our enemies  theres a better way  and thats why we need to reject any politics  any politics  that targets people because of race or religion  let me just say this this is not a matter of political correctness this is a matter of understanding just what it is that makes us strong the world respects us not just for our arsenal it respects us for our diversity and our openness and the way we respect every faith his holiness pope francis told this body from the very spot that im standing on tonight that to imitate the hatred and violence of tyrants and murderers is the best way to take their place when politicians insult muslims whether abroad or our fellow citizens when a mosque is vandalized or a kid is called names that doesnt make us safer thats not telling it like it is its just wrong  it diminishes us in the eyes of the world it makes it harder to achieve our goals it betrays who we are as a country  we the people our constitution begins with those three simple words words weve come to recognize mean all the people not just some words that insist we rise and fall together and thats how we might perfect our union and that brings me to the fourth and maybe the most important thing that i want to say tonight the future we want  all of us want  opportunity and security for our families a rising standard of living a sustainable peaceful planet for our kids  all that is within our reach but it will only happen if we work together it will only happen if we can have rational constructive debates it will only happen if we fix our politics a better politics doesnt mean we have to agree on everything this is a big country  different regions different attitudes different interests thats one of our strengths too our founders distributed power between states and branches of government and expected us to argue just as they did fiercely over the size and shape of government over commerce and foreign relations over the meaning of liberty and the imperatives of security but democracy does require basic bonds of trust between its citizens it doesnt work if we think the people who disagree with us are all motivated by malice it doesnt work if we think that our political opponents are unpatriotic or trying to weaken america democracy grinds to a halt without a willingness to compromise or when even basic facts are contested or when we listen only to those who agree with us our public life withers when only the most extreme voices get all the attention and most of all democracy breaks down when the average person feels their voice doesnt matter that the system is rigged in favor of the rich or the powerful or some special interest too many americans feel that way right now its one of the few regrets of my presidency  that the rancor and suspicion between the parties has gotten worse instead of better i have no doubt a president with the gifts of lincoln or roosevelt might have better bridged the divide and i guarantee ill keep trying to be better so long as i hold this office but my fellow americans this cannot be my task  or any presidents  alone there are a whole lot of folks in this chamber good people who would like to see more cooperation would like to see a more elevated debate in washington but feel trapped by the imperatives of getting elected by the noise coming out of your base i know youve told me its the worstkept secret in washington and a lot of you arent enjoying being trapped in that kind of rancor but that means if we want a better politics  and im addressing the american people now  if we want a better politics its not enough just to change a congressman or change a senator or even change a president we have to change the system to reflect our better selves i think weve got to end the practice of drawing our congressional districts so that politicians can pick their voters and not the other way around  let a bipartisan group do it  we have to reduce the influence of money in our politics so that a handful of families or hidden interests cant bankroll our elections  and if our existing approach to campaign finance reform cant pass muster in the courts we need to work together to find a real solution  because its a problem and most of you dont like raising money i know ive done it  weve got to make it easier to vote not harder  we need to modernize it for the way we live now  this is america we want to make it easier for people to participate and over the course of this year i intend to travel the country to push for reforms that do just that but i cant do these things on my own  changes in our political process  in not just who gets elected but how they get elected  that will only happen when the american people demand it it depends on you thats whats meant by a government of by and for the people what im suggesting is hard its a lot easier to be cynical to accept that change is not possible and politics is hopeless and the problem is all the folks who are elected dont care and to believe that our voices and actions dont matter but if we give up now then we forsake a better future those with money and power will gain greater control over the decisions that could send a young soldier to war or allow another economic disaster or roll back the equal rights and voting rights that generations of americans have fought even died to secure and then as frustration grows there will be voices urging us to fall back into our respective tribes to scapegoat fellow citizens who dont look like us or pray like us or vote like we do or share the same background we cant afford to go down that path it wont deliver the economy we want it will not produce the security we want but most of all it contradicts everything that makes us the envy of the world so my fellow americans whatever you may believe whether you prefer one party or no party whether you supported my agenda or fought as hard as you could against it  our collective futures depends on your willingness to uphold your duties as a citizen to vote to speak out to stand up for others especially the weak especially the vulnerable knowing that each of us is only here because somebody somewhere stood up for us  we need every american to stay active in our public life  and not just during election time  so that our public life reflects the goodness and the decency that i see in the american people every single day it is not easy our brand of democracy is hard but i can promise that a little over a year from now when i no longer hold this office i will be right there with you as a citizen inspired by those voices of fairness and vision of grit and good humor and kindness that helped america travel so far voices that help us see ourselves not first and foremost as black or white or asian or latino not as gay or straight immigrant or native born not as democrat or republican but as americans first bound by a common creed voices dr king believed would have the final word  voices of unarmed truth and unconditional love and theyre out there those voices they dont get a lot of attention they dont seek a lot of fanfare but theyre busy doing the work this country needs doing i see them everywhere i travel in this incredible country of ours i see you the american people and in your daily acts of citizenship i see our future unfolding i see it in the worker on the assembly line who clocked extra shifts to keep his company open and the boss who pays him higher wages instead of laying him off i see it in the dreamer who stays up late to finish her science project and the teacher who comes in early because he knows she might someday cure a disease i see it in the american who served his time and made mistakes as a child but now is dreaming of starting over  and i see it in the business owner who gives him that second chance the protester determined to prove that justice matters  and the young cop walking the beat treating everybody with respect doing the brave quiet work of keeping us safe  i see it in the soldier who gives almost everything to save his brothers the nurse who tends to him till he can run a marathon the community that lines up to cheer him on its the son who finds the courage to come out as who he is and the father whose love for that son overrides everything hes been taught  i see it in the elderly woman who will wait in line to cast her vote as long as she has to the new citizen who casts his vote for the first time the volunteers at the polls who believe every vote should count  because each of them in different ways know how much that precious right is worth thats the america i know thats the country we love cleareyed bighearted undaunted by challenge optimistic that unarmed truth and unconditional love will have the final word  thats what makes me so hopeful about our future i believe in change because i believe in you the american people and thats why i stand here confident as i have ever been that the state of our union is strong  thank you god bless you god bless the united states of america'"
